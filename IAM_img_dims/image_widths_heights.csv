Lines/j06/j06-000/j06-000-07.png, 1807, 157, from the Antarctic , the metanauplii remain 
Lines/j06/j06-000/j06-000-08.png, 1685, 136, in deep water , the later larval stages 
Lines/j06/j06-000/j06-000-09.png, 1705, 163, migrate diurnally , and the adolescents

Lines/e04/e04-083/e04-083-04.png, 1613, 127, notches , as they are not fastened to the 
Lines/e04/e04-083/e04-083-05.png, 1532, 135, moulds , which will only be used whilst 
Lines/e04/e04-083/e04-083-06.png, 1194, 86, the hull is under construction . 
Lines/e04/e04-062/e04-062-00.png, 1837, 82, This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure 
Lines/e04/e04-062/e04-062-01.png, 1898, 108, a permanently water proof glue line . Be sure to 
Lines/e04/e04-062/e04-062-02.png, 2056, 101, see that the edge bears the mark , P.M.B.C. Exterior . 
Lines/e04/e04-062/e04-062-03.png, 2089, 100, This may be bought at any good timber merchants . 
Lines/e04/e04-062/e04-062-04.png, 2005, 82, The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply 
Lines/e04/e04-062/e04-062-05.png, 2168, 89, wood of the same make , or oak or mahogany . For the 
Lines/e04/e04-062/e04-062-06.png, 2100, 102, last one I made , I used the two flaps from an old 
Lines/e04/e04-062/e04-062-07.png, 2122, 112, mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one 
Lines/e04/e04-062/e04-062-08.png, 366, 121, shilling . 
Lines/e04/e04-095/e04-095-00.png, 1746, 148, The skeleton of the boat will now take shape , 
Lines/e04/e04-095/e04-095-01.png, 1751, 123, and this is the time to check before making fast 
Lines/e04/e04-095/e04-095-02.png, 1681, 113, to see that nothing is distorted . Ensure that 
Lines/e04/e04-095/e04-095-03.png, 1749, 109, the outside measurements from transom to transom 
Lines/e04/e04-095/e04-095-04.png, 1751, 123, are equal on each side and that the transoms 
Lines/e04/e04-095/e04-095-05.png, 1760, 114, are parallel horizontally . Next bevel the chines 
Lines/e04/e04-095/e04-095-06.png, 1819, 113, with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly . 
Lines/e04/e04-026/e04-026-00.png, 1770, 121, Finally attach the back firmly to the sides with 
Lines/e04/e04-026/e04-026-01.png, 1758, 126, screws driven from the inside . The footrest is a 
Lines/e04/e04-026/e04-026-02.png, 1679, 161, piece of timber 14 in. long and about 1/2 in. 
Lines/e04/e04-026/e04-026-03.png, 1816, 165, by 4 in. attached to the front legs with a pair 
Lines/e04/e04-026/e04-026-04.png, 1913, 157, of angle irons as shown in Fig. 5 . When determining 
Lines/e04/e04-026/e04-026-05.png, 1768, 151, the position of the footrest , do not place too near 
Lines/e04/e04-026/e04-026-06.png, 1849, 177, the seat to allow for the growth of baby's legs . 
Lines/e04/e04-109/e04-109-00.png, 1725, 161, Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws ( brass ) or nail 
Lines/e04/e04-109/e04-109-01.png, 1716, 164, with inch and a quarter galvanized nails , if 
Lines/e04/e04-109/e04-109-02.png, 1761, 173, you are doing it that way . Use flat head screws 
Lines/e04/e04-109/e04-109-03.png, 1748, 163, about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in 
Lines/e04/e04-109/e04-109-04.png, 1743, 184, the 1/4 in. ply . Make a very small hole for 
Lines/e04/e04-109/e04-109-05.png, 1767, 175, the screw to allow for a good grip . Remember 
Lines/e04/e04-109/e04-109-06.png, 921, 186, to glue before screwing . 
Lines/e04/e04-004/e04-004-00.png, 1832, 117, Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed 
Lines/e04/e04-004/e04-004-01.png, 1918, 120, timber as shown in Fig. 1 . Although the timber will have already 
Lines/e04/e04-004/e04-004-02.png, 1837, 131, been machine planed , remember to go over each piece with 
Lines/e04/e04-004/e04-004-03.png, 1823, 134, a smoothing plane , otherwise the marks left by the cutters 
Lines/e04/e04-004/e04-004-04.png, 1859, 124, will show up after painting . The dimensions given enable the 
Lines/e04/e04-004/e04-004-05.png, 1767, 132, feeding tray to slide over a 30 in. table , but the height 
Lines/e04/e04-004/e04-004-06.png, 895, 115, can be altered if required . 
Lines/e04/e04-099/e04-099-00.png, 1773, 120, Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the 
Lines/e04/e04-099/e04-099-01.png, 1770, 126, plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for 
Lines/e04/e04-099/e04-099-02.png, 1736, 126, planing after fixing to the boat . Use your two 
Lines/e04/e04-099/e04-099-03.png, 1581, 143, lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this 
Lines/e04/e04-099/e04-099-04.png, 1787, 131, purpose , the sides from one , and the bottom from 
Lines/e04/e04-099/e04-099-05.png, 1755, 102, the other . If care is taken not to waste the 
Lines/e04/e04-099/e04-099-06.png, 1794, 133, ply , plenty of material is left over for the thwarts . 
Lines/e04/e04-008/e04-008-00.png, 1731, 119, All the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned , 
Lines/e04/e04-008/e04-008-01.png, 1809, 74, which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat 
Lines/e04/e04-008/e04-008-02.png, 1792, 113, appearance . The side frames are joined by four cross pieces 
Lines/e04/e04-008/e04-008-03.png, 1920, 113, each 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. by 14 in. which fit into the recesses ( C ) , 
Lines/e04/e04-008/e04-008-04.png, 509, 111, cut to fit them . 
Lines/e04/e04-132/e04-132-00.png, 1778, 142, While these may ultimately be made into a picture 
Lines/e04/e04-132/e04-132-01.png, 1708, 139, for framing and hanging on a wall , they may 
Lines/e04/e04-132/e04-132-02.png, 1636, 103, also be arranged into a design , and the 
Lines/e04/e04-132/e04-132-03.png, 1693, 137, resulting panel utilized for decorating a useful

Lines/e04/e04-119/e04-119-00.png, 1730, 157, Again , don't forget to glue . Now put on the keel and 
Lines/e04/e04-119/e04-119-01.png, 1801, 146, the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off 
Lines/e04/e04-119/e04-119-02.png, 1858, 129, the moulds . You won't want them again for this boat , so 
Lines/e04/e04-119/e04-119-03.png, 1860, 139, shift them right out of the way . Place the boat right side 
Lines/e04/e04-119/e04-119-04.png, 1711, 184, up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for 
Lines/e04/e04-119/e04-119-05.png, 246, 135, working .

Lines/e04/e04-000/e04-000-02.png, 1731, 105, commercial articles , this chair is solidly built and 
Lines/e04/e04-000/e04-000-03.png, 1752, 134, capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the 
Lines/e04/e04-000/e04-000-04.png, 1819, 135, most destructive youngster . Almost any available 
Lines/e04/e04-000/e04-000-05.png, 1559, 103, timber can be used but Parana pine is 
Lines/e04/e04-000/e04-000-06.png, 1702, 114, recommended , being cheap , easy to work , and 
Lines/e04/e04-000/e04-000-07.png, 908, 114, taking a good finish . 
Lines/e04/e04-043/e04-043-00.png, 1793, 146, Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little 
Lines/e04/e04-043/e04-043-01.png, 1782, 128, rowing dinghy many of which I have built and 
Lines/e04/e04-043/e04-043-02.png, 1747, 107, sold . It is especially designed for simplicity in 
Lines/e04/e04-043/e04-043-03.png, 1807, 108, construction , cheapness and lightness of weight , 
Lines/e04/e04-043/e04-043-04.png, 1795, 97, and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She

Lines/e04/e04-124/e04-124-04.png, 1775, 145, before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put 
Lines/e04/e04-124/e04-124-05.png, 1849, 140, a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside ( gunwale ) 
Lines/e04/e04-124/e04-124-06.png, 690, 145, one to fit the block . 
Lines/e04/e04-114/e04-114-00.png, 1729, 175, Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom , 
Lines/e04/e04-114/e04-114-01.png, 1750, 203, which is cut in one piece . It should overlap just a 
Lines/e04/e04-114/e04-114-02.png, 1722, 179, trifle ; this can be cleaned up later . As you are 
Lines/e04/e04-114/e04-114-03.png, 1776, 166, screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is 
Lines/e04/e04-114/e04-114-04.png, 1727, 164, necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with 
Lines/e04/e04-114/e04-114-05.png, 1778, 174, the screws . I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for 
Lines/e04/e04-114/e04-114-06.png, 1765, 168, the bottom , both for screwing to the chines and 
Lines/e04/e04-114/e04-114-07.png, 1327, 183, the bottom shaped transom facing .

Lines/e04/e04-015/e04-015-07.png, 1720, 129, is made from 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. timber . 
Lines/e04/e04-091/e04-091-00.png, 1736, 134, The chines are morticed into this and butt up 
Lines/e04/e04-091/e04-091-01.png, 1618, 109, against the transom . Start at the bow and 
Lines/e04/e04-091/e04-091-02.png, 1673, 106, spring them both at the same time over the 
Lines/e04/e04-091/e04-091-03.png, 1701, 74, slots cut in the moulds and into the notches 
Lines/e04/e04-091/e04-091-04.png, 1609, 122, cut for this purpose in the stern or after

Lines/e04/e04-103/e04-103-00.png, 1772, 142, Having trimmed up the chines , we are now ready 
Lines/e04/e04-103/e04-103-01.png, 1715, 151, to plank the sides . Start again at the bows , 
Lines/e04/e04-103/e04-103-02.png, 1760, 146, clamping into position with a ' D ' clamp . Bend 
Lines/e04/e04-103/e04-103-03.png, 1812, 153, round the frame to the stern and clamp there . If 
Lines/e04/e04-103/e04-103-04.png, 1797, 153, you have a third clamp use it in the centre as 
Lines/e04/e04-103/e04-103-05.png, 1772, 154, well . After generously covering with glue , screw 
Lines/e04/e04-103/e04-103-06.png, 1816, 169, the sides to the transom framing and the chine . 
Lines/e04/e04-086/e04-086-00.png, 1817, 125, The chine is the long stringer on each side which 
Lines/e04/e04-086/e04-086-01.png, 1766, 113, is joined to both transoms and lies in the grooves 
Lines/e04/e04-086/e04-086-02.png, 1800, 122, cut in the moulds . Each chine is made of oak , 
Lines/e04/e04-086/e04-086-03.png, 1772, 111, ash , spruce or any long grained flexible wood . I 
Lines/e04/e04-086/e04-086-04.png, 1747, 131, prefer spruce when available . As will be seen 
Lines/e04/e04-086/e04-086-05.png, 1678, 118, in the plan , the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in. 
Lines/e04/e04-086/e04-086-06.png, 604, 74, on each side . 
Lines/e04/e04-019/e04-019-00.png, 1714, 107, The amount of the backward tilt and 
Lines/e04/e04-019/e04-019-01.png, 1854, 145, also the height is left to personal choice 
Lines/e04/e04-019/e04-019-02.png, 1795, 161, and the width is best taken directly 
Lines/e04/e04-019/e04-019-03.png, 1803, 196, from the work to ensure a good fit . 
Lines/e04/e04-019/e04-019-04.png, 1742, 145, Fix the piece A to the sides first

Lines/e04/e04-068/e04-068-00.png, 1796, 77, I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for 
Lines/e04/e04-068/e04-068-01.png, 1874, 115, rowing this dinghy ( Fig. 3 ) . They are very simple , cheap 
Lines/e04/e04-068/e04-068-02.png, 1751, 95, and easy to make . As will be seen from the plan 
Lines/e04/e04-068/e04-068-03.png, 1783, 100, there is only a single gunwale on the outside . 
Lines/e04/e04-068/e04-068-04.png, 1918, 119, I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada 
Lines/e04/e04-068/e04-068-05.png, 1981, 91, is difficult to obtain here and expensive . I overcome 
Lines/e04/e04-068/e04-068-06.png, 1442, 96, this in another way as shown in Fig. 4 . 
Lines/e04/e04-030/e04-030-00.png, 1713, 163, To complete the job , screw two fittings to the 
Lines/e04/e04-030/e04-030-01.png, 1747, 123, inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the 
Lines/e04/e04-030/e04-030-02.png, 1735, 133, back to hold the baby's safety harness . These can be 
Lines/e04/e04-030/e04-030-03.png, 1763, 166, made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout 
Lines/e04/e04-030/e04-030-04.png, 1662, 144, wire as shown in Fig. 6 . Make sure that these 
Lines/e04/e04-030/e04-030-05.png, 1786, 118, are well secured as they will have to withstand 
Lines/e04/e04-030/e04-030-06.png, 1775, 150, considerable pulling as the child becomes older . 
Lines/e04/e04-034/e04-034-00.png, 1809, 109, Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes 
Lines/e04/e04-034/e04-034-01.png, 1734, 117, with plastic wood . Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole 
Lines/e04/e04-034/e04-034-02.png, 1727, 126, framework and round off any sharp edges ( such as the 
Lines/e04/e04-034/e04-034-03.png, 1709, 150, edge of the seat , feeding tray , etc ) . Fill the grain with a 
Lines/e04/e04-034/e04-034-04.png, 1780, 119, woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in 
Lines/e04/e04-034/e04-034-05.png, 1780, 142, a suitable pastel shade , using a contrasting colour 
Lines/e04/e04-034/e04-034-06.png, 1751, 138, for the seat and the back which can be decorated with 
Lines/e04/e04-034/e04-034-07.png, 1060, 126, a suitable nursery transfer . 
Lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-00.png, 1772, 113, With something of a start I remembered the 
Lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-01.png, 1721, 113, man who 'd brought us into this business . 
Lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-02.png, 1742, 127, " Maybe you don't know about Appleton , 
Lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-03.png, 1745, 131, Dan ? " " Know what ? " " That he 's dead , " 
Lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-04.png, 1787, 125, I said . I watched him because I was always 
Lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-05.png, 1760, 130, fascinated by the way he looked when you 
Lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-06.png, 1815, 112, tried to surprise him . " Dead ? " he said . " Yes . 
Lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-07.png, 1706, 97, Dead . Shuffled out of the deck . Blasted 
Lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-08.png, 1676, 117, down with a shotgun outside the Palace 
Lines/n06/n06-100/n06-100-09.png, 464, 126, last night . " 
Lines/n06/n06-082/n06-082-00.png, 1763, 118, " Yes , " he said . " I know . " " No harm must come 
Lines/n06/n06-082/n06-082-01.png, 1774, 124, to her , Dan . " " She 'll be all right . It 's the 
Lines/n06/n06-082/n06-082-02.png, 1753, 100, men who 'll be after that coach I 'm interested 
Lines/n06/n06-082/n06-082-03.png, 1656, 133, in , Johnny . " " I know . But if lead starts 
Lines/n06/n06-082/n06-082-04.png, 1702, 143, flying she might be in danger . " " That 's so . 
Lines/n06/n06-082/n06-082-05.png, 1691, 171, But I reckon they 'll be too busy shooting at 
Lines/n06/n06-082/n06-082-06.png, 1672, 90, us to bother with the coach and the folks 
Lines/n06/n06-082/n06-082-07.png, 245, 74, in it . " 
Lines/n06/n06-119/n06-119-00.png, 1649, 105, The air was fresh and clear and you 
Lines/n06/n06-119/n06-119-01.png, 1707, 127, could see far over west and north for many 
Lines/n06/n06-119/n06-119-02.png, 1729, 126, miles . The real high country of the Rockies 
Lines/n06/n06-119/n06-119-03.png, 1759, 106, lifted up in the distance like a pale water- 
Lines/n06/n06-119/n06-119-04.png, 1682, 124, colour drawing . Between us and that lay 
Lines/n06/n06-119/n06-119-05.png, 1661, 122, a vast stretch of hills , canyons , buttes and 
Lines/n06/n06-119/n06-119-06.png, 280, 121, malpais . 
Lines/n06/n06-092/n06-092-00.png, 1821, 129, " Maybe , " I said . " But we 've got to remember 
Lines/n06/n06-092/n06-092-01.png, 1740, 115, that girl all the time , Dan . I feel kind 
Lines/n06/n06-092/n06-092-02.png, 1748, 127, of responsible for her . " " Of course , " he said , 
Lines/n06/n06-092/n06-092-03.png, 1667, 131, giving me one of his strange looks . Then he 
Lines/n06/n06-092/n06-092-04.png, 1643, 79, turned the conversation . " Let 's ride over 
Lines/n06/n06-092/n06-092-05.png, 1726, 106, and have a look at the mining camp . 
Lines/n06/n06-092/n06-092-06.png, 1726, 114, After all it 's them we 're supposed to be 
Lines/n06/n06-092/n06-092-07.png, 1727, 106, working for , as well as the townsfolk and 
Lines/n06/n06-092/n06-092-08.png, 873, 144, the agency detective . " 
Lines/n06/n06-074/n06-074-00.png, 1798, 123, He rode down to where I was waiting . I was 
Lines/n06/n06-074/n06-074-01.png, 1784, 155, thinking what a skill he had for reading 
Lines/n06/n06-074/n06-074-02.png, 1806, 149, my mind . " This would be as good a place 
Lines/n06/n06-074/n06-074-03.png, 1770, 153, for a hold-up as any , " he said , reining in 
Lines/n06/n06-074/n06-074-04.png, 1750, 94, near me . " Yes , " I said . " It 'll be here to- 
Lines/n06/n06-074/n06-074-05.png, 1706, 127, morrow as likely as not . " I paused . " Miss 
Lines/n06/n06-074/n06-074-06.png, 1428, 107, Jeannie 'll be on that coach , Dan . " 
Lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-00.png, 1706, 112, " The mine-workings lie north of the town , " 
Lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-01.png, 1653, 117, said Dan . " If we head west we ought to 
Lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-02.png, 1838, 144, cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north . " 
Lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-03.png, 1708, 129, So we swung west , making slow going over 
Lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-04.png, 1756, 125, rough country , sliding on shale , climbing down 
Lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-05.png, 1584, 133, into draws , circling a big mesa by a 
Lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-06.png, 1724, 126, four or five mile valley , sandy-floored . It 
Lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-07.png, 1763, 128, got hotter as the day wore on and we rested 
Lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-08.png, 1718, 107, gratefully by a small creek where we watered 
Lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-09.png, 1583, 107, the horses and drank enough to cure our 
Lines/n06/n06-123/n06-123-10.png, 252, 70, thirst . 
Lines/n06/n06-169/n06-169-00.png, 1776, 125, " They gives you the wind , " said the Sodbuster 
Lines/n06/n06-169/n06-169-01.png, 1658, 77, handing them to us , " but it 's all we got 
Lines/n06/n06-169/n06-169-02.png, 1730, 69, as of now , apart from a few sacks of gold 
Lines/n06/n06-169/n06-169-03.png, 1649, 69, dust . " He winked at his partners . They all 
Lines/n06/n06-169/n06-169-04.png, 1772, 54, watched us as we ate the beans . Then when 
Lines/n06/n06-169/n06-169-05.png, 1610, 72, we 'd finished and I 'd rolled a cigarette 
Lines/n06/n06-169/n06-169-06.png, 1764, 77, the man called Shorty said , " You were saying when 
Lines/n06/n06-169/n06-169-07.png, 1650, 67, you came in that 2somep'n happened last 
Lines/n06/n06-169/n06-169-08.png, 261, 71, night . " 
Lines/n06/n06-148/n06-148-00.png, 1696, 87, I saw several men running down towards 
Lines/n06/n06-148/n06-148-01.png, 1647, 79, the shack . They were all armed with rifles . 
Lines/n06/n06-148/n06-148-02.png, 1635, 60, As the nearest of them came round the 
Lines/n06/n06-148/n06-148-03.png, 1848, 75, shack , his rifle at the ready , I saw it was Nick 
Lines/n06/n06-148/n06-148-04.png, 1680, 83, Dowd , still wearing his blue check shirt . He 
Lines/n06/n06-148/n06-148-05.png, 1738, 72, came up close , eyeing us suspiciously . " We 've 
Lines/n06/n06-148/n06-148-06.png, 1725, 76, come 2a-calling , " I said . " Can't see no reason 
Lines/n06/n06-148/n06-148-07.png, 1774, 86, for calling , " he said . " Still long as you 're here 
Lines/n06/n06-148/n06-148-08.png, 1286, 64, you may as well stay a while . 
Lines/n06/n06-175/n06-175-00.png, 1640, 114, " Yes , " I said . " Something happened all right . 
Lines/n06/n06-175/n06-175-01.png, 1582, 79, After you 'd left the meeting , mister " - I 
Lines/n06/n06-175/n06-175-02.png, 1611, 63, looked across at Nick Dowd - " someone cut 
Lines/n06/n06-175/n06-175-03.png, 1586, 75, down William Appleton outside the Palace 
Lines/n06/n06-175/n06-175-04.png, 1711, 98, with a shotgun . " I paused and watched my 
Lines/n06/n06-175/n06-175-05.png, 1693, 73, words affect them in their different ways . 
Lines/n06/n06-175/n06-175-06.png, 1743, 88, " That 's sure bad news , " said Dowd , sombrely . 
Lines/n06/n06-175/n06-175-07.png, 1612, 106, " It 2jest about leaves everything wide open 
Lines/n06/n06-175/n06-175-08.png, 1560, 66, for Mr. Pell and his bunch , " observed 
Lines/n06/n06-175/n06-175-09.png, 251, 62, Shorty . 
Lines/n06/n06-111/n06-111-00.png, 1699, 108, " Fenton or Somers , " he said . " Or the Town 
Lines/n06/n06-111/n06-111-01.png, 1708, 116, Marshal , " I added . His face was fixed , 
Lines/n06/n06-111/n06-111-02.png, 1683, 131, unreadable as a rock . " Let 's get over to the 
Lines/n06/n06-111/n06-111-03.png, 1797, 132, mining camp , " he said abruptly . He wheeled 
Lines/n06/n06-111/n06-111-04.png, 1773, 109, his horse back off the trail and up the slope 
Lines/n06/n06-111/n06-111-05.png, 1633, 112, leading to the ridge . I followed . From the 
Lines/n06/n06-111/n06-111-06.png, 1801, 132, top you could see something of the wild hill 
Lines/n06/n06-111/n06-111-07.png, 1754, 116, country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing . 
Lines/n06/n06-133/n06-133-00.png, 1721, 132, We didn't approach unchallenged . Just short 
Lines/n06/n06-133/n06-133-01.png, 1658, 141, of the diggings there was a roughly-built 
Lines/n06/n06-133/n06-133-02.png, 1804, 116, shack and as we got near someone inside bawled 
Lines/n06/n06-133/n06-133-03.png, 1646, 132, out , " If you come any closer , I 'll sure blow 
Lines/n06/n06-133/n06-133-04.png, 1788, 122, your whiskers off . " " Take it easy , mister , " I sang 
Lines/n06/n06-133/n06-133-05.png, 1865, 128, out . " We don't aim to come any closer and we 've 
Lines/n06/n06-133/n06-133-06.png, 1755, 98, got no whiskers so as you can see . Just you 
Lines/n06/n06-133/n06-133-07.png, 1738, 86, go and tell Nick Dowd we 've come to talk 
Lines/n06/n06-133/n06-133-08.png, 1759, 116, to him about what happened last night . " 
Lines/n06/n06-140/n06-140-00.png, 1621, 119, " Oh , " said the unseen guard . He blew a 
Lines/n06/n06-140/n06-140-01.png, 1728, 107, whistle then , loud and shrill . The gun barrel 
Lines/n06/n06-140/n06-140-02.png, 1740, 116, peeking out through a hole in the shack never 
Lines/n06/n06-140/n06-140-03.png, 1725, 107, wavered . We sat our horses , waiting . " Looks as 
Lines/n06/n06-140/n06-140-04.png, 1825, 132, though they 're expecting trouble , " I said . " Where 
Lines/n06/n06-140/n06-140-05.png, 1794, 113, there 's gold and women there 's always trouble , " 
Lines/n06/n06-140/n06-140-06.png, 1773, 116, observed Dan , shifting about in his saddle . He 
Lines/n06/n06-140/n06-140-07.png, 946, 103, was never long on patience . 
Lines/n06/n06-186/n06-186-00.png, 1677, 101, " Yeah , " said Dowd dubiously . " 2Mebbe we 'd 
Lines/n06/n06-186/n06-186-01.png, 1723, 73, better . " Surprisingly Dan Maffrey came in at 
Lines/n06/n06-186/n06-186-02.png, 1666, 66, that point . " If you do , " he said , " you 'll be 
Lines/n06/n06-186/n06-186-03.png, 1675, 83, sure asking for trouble . They 'll be on your 
Lines/n06/n06-186/n06-186-04.png, 1803, 66, necks before you can say ' knife ' . It wouldn't 
Lines/n06/n06-186/n06-186-05.png, 1692, 85, be the first time they 've held up a diggings 
Lines/n06/n06-186/n06-186-06.png, 1726, 77, at gun point either . They 've done it before 
Lines/n06/n06-186/n06-186-07.png, 1010, 80, and got away with it . " 
Lines/n06/n06-182/n06-182-00.png, 1640, 88, The rest of the men there said nothing but 
Lines/n06/n06-182/n06-182-01.png, 1631, 73, you could see they were hard hit . They were 
Lines/n06/n06-182/n06-182-02.png, 1709, 66, simple men who knew a lot maybe about 
Lines/n06/n06-182/n06-182-03.png, 1625, 78, digging for gold but were babes in arms 
Lines/n06/n06-182/n06-182-04.png, 1738, 74, when it came to dealing with owlhooters and 
Lines/n06/n06-182/n06-182-05.png, 1673, 67, desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the 
Lines/n06/n06-182/n06-182-06.png, 1742, 101, rest . " I guess we 'd better hold onto the gold 
Lines/n06/n06-182/n06-182-07.png, 1535, 82, right 2hyar , Nick , " said the Sodbuster . 
Lines/n06/n06-194/n06-194-00.png, 1727, 116, " You 're 2durned tootin' , mister , " said the man 
Lines/n06/n06-194/n06-194-01.png, 1736, 93, called Roper Smith . " We 've got five rifles among 
Lines/n06/n06-194/n06-194-02.png, 1684, 62, us and a few six-shooters . But most of us 
Lines/n06/n06-194/n06-194-03.png, 1606, 56, 2ain't 2eddicated in shootin' . It 'd be a 
Lines/n06/n06-194/n06-194-04.png, 1689, 71, 2massacree , 2yessir . " " If you 'll take a chance 
Lines/n06/n06-194/n06-194-05.png, 1728, 78, on getting your gold to the bank , then we 'll 
Lines/n06/n06-194/n06-194-06.png, 1675, 82, abide by what we said at the meeting , " 
Lines/n06/n06-194/n06-194-07.png, 1835, 88, said Dan . " We 'll watch the stage out of reach . " 
Lines/n06/n06-201/n06-201-00.png, 1586, 76, I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in 
Lines/n06/n06-201/n06-201-01.png, 1648, 85, with Dan Maffrey's aim to avenge himself 
Lines/n06/n06-201/n06-201-02.png, 1542, 52, on the Fenton bunch but still it was a 
Lines/n06/n06-201/n06-201-03.png, 1610, 76, handsome offer so I chimed in too . " That 
Lines/n06/n06-201/n06-201-04.png, 1727, 91, goes for me , gentlemen , " I said . " If they do try 
Lines/n06/n06-201/n06-201-05.png, 1706, 71, and hold up the stage , it 'll be a couple or 
Lines/n06/n06-201/n06-201-06.png, 1700, 63, three of them , no more . I reckon we can deal 
Lines/n06/n06-201/n06-201-07.png, 784, 88, with them all right . " 
Lines/n06/n06-128/n06-128-00.png, 1719, 126, An hour's riding brought us to a trail that 
Lines/n06/n06-128/n06-128-01.png, 1676, 95, we figured would lead to the miners' camp . 
Lines/n06/n06-128/n06-128-02.png, 1746, 100, We turned north into it and after about four 
Lines/n06/n06-128/n06-128-03.png, 1592, 126, miles it led into a small canyon which 
Lines/n06/n06-128/n06-128-04.png, 1690, 94, opened out into a wide shallow draw . 
Lines/n06/n06-128/n06-128-05.png, 1691, 97, Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found 
Lines/n06/n06-128/n06-128-06.png, 1692, 121, the miners at work . They were scattered 
Lines/n06/n06-128/n06-128-07.png, 1632, 129, over a fairly wide area working singly or 
Lines/n06/n06-128/n06-128-08.png, 324, 90, in pairs . 
Lines/n06/n06-163/n06-163-00.png, 1767, 59, A small man in bib overalls and a battered 
Lines/n06/n06-163/n06-163-01.png, 1747, 69, Derby hat fussed around the stove . " 2Ain't 
Lines/n06/n06-163/n06-163-02.png, 1721, 78, exactly the Ritz Hotel but we 've got our little 
Lines/n06/n06-163/n06-163-03.png, 1626, 63, comforts , " said Dowd . He introduced the men 
Lines/n06/n06-163/n06-163-04.png, 1656, 74, who 'd come in as Roper Smith , Shorty , Mick 
Lines/n06/n06-163/n06-163-05.png, 1740, 78, Golightly , Swede and the Sodbuster . This last was 
Lines/n06/n06-163/n06-163-06.png, 1663, 74, the little hombre in big overalls . Very soon he 
Lines/n06/n06-163/n06-163-07.png, 1555, 73, had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee 
Lines/n06/n06-163/n06-163-08.png, 1640, 54, sweetened with molasses for all and for us 
Lines/n06/n06-163/n06-163-09.png, 1217, 58, there were two plates of beans . 
Lines/n06/n06-156/n06-156-00.png, 1611, 75, 'Light an' come on in . " We dismounted and 
Lines/n06/n06-156/n06-156-01.png, 1615, 78, one of the miners who 'd come along with 
Lines/n06/n06-156/n06-156-02.png, 1707, 61, Nick Dowd took our horses off to water . 
Lines/n06/n06-156/n06-156-03.png, 1580, 62, We followed Nick Dowd into the shack . 
Lines/n06/n06-156/n06-156-04.png, 1771, 89, They 'd rigged up a stove of sorts and on it 
Lines/n06/n06-156/n06-156-05.png, 1628, 73, a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed . Other 
Lines/n06/n06-156/n06-156-06.png, 1801, 56, miners followed in at our heels . Nick Dowd 
Lines/n06/n06-156/n06-156-07.png, 1681, 61, found us a couple of boxes to sit on . 
Lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-00.png, 1763, 114, Prudence , ambition and reason had 
Lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-01.png, 1877, 170, held instinct in check , and they must 
Lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-02.png, 1907, 123, dictate her course . There could be no 
Lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-03.png, 1807, 152, compromise . For a brief interval 
Lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-04.png, 1840, 151, she allowed herself the luxury of 
Lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-05.png, 1822, 191, dreams . She began to imagine life at 
Lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-06.png, 1926, 141, Bracciano , the balls and fe*?5tes , the 
Lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-07.png, 1999, 117, conversation of poets and dilettanti . She 
Lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-08.png, 2007, 161, visualized the pageantry of the tourna- 
Lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-09.png, 2026, 146, ment , and herself on the ducal dais beside 
Lines/k04/k04-079/k04-079-10.png, 2087, 169, Orsini , placing a chaplet of roses on the brows 
Lines/k04/k04-050/k04-050-00.png, 1898, 110, Before replying to this , she glanced 
Lines/k04/k04-050/k04-050-01.png, 1910, 121, hastily around , then spoke in tones so low that he 
Lines/k04/k04-050/k04-050-02.png, 1883, 83, had to bend his head to hear : ' I will never be 
Lines/k04/k04-050/k04-050-03.png, 1873, 98, any man's mistress . As to marrying again ... 
Lines/k04/k04-050/k04-050-04.png, 1921, 88, if I were free ... there is only one man I would 
Lines/k04/k04-050/k04-050-05.png, 1882, 84, wish to marry ... but ... he , like myself , is now 
Lines/k04/k04-050/k04-050-06.png, 241, 88, bound . ' 
Lines/k04/k04-126/k04-126-00.png, 1713, 207, She shrugged her shoulders , and replied in the same 
Lines/k04/k04-126/k04-126-01.png, 1708, 204, language : ' Yes . But make it worth her while . ' 
Lines/k04/k04-126/k04-126-02.png, 1722, 120, ' I see . I know how to deal with people like that , ' 
Lines/k04/k04-126/k04-126-03.png, 1749, 199, and turning to the cowering Lucia , he spoke in her 
Lines/k04/k04-126/k04-126-04.png, 1743, 209, own language . ' Do you know who I am ? ' ' No , 
Lines/k04/k04-126/k04-126-05.png, 1759, 277, signor , ' she whispered . ' I am the Orsini . My word is 
Lines/k04/k04-126/k04-126-06.png, 478, 85, law in Rome . ' 
Lines/k04/k04-156/k04-156-00.png, 2049, 138, ' In that case , ' he reverted to French , ' I shall be obliged 
Lines/k04/k04-156/k04-156-01.png, 2023, 133, to lift you from the coach . ' Without answering him , she 
Lines/k04/k04-156/k04-156-02.png, 2021, 142, rose , and bending over the agitated girl , said softly : 
Lines/k04/k04-156/k04-156-03.png, 2036, 141, ' No one will harm you , Lucia . Remain here . ' Ignoring his 
Lines/k04/k04-156/k04-156-04.png, 2080, 217, proffered hand , she stepped from the vehicle . ' Will you 
Lines/k04/k04-156/k04-156-05.png, 2093, 134, be so good as to order your men not to molest my 
Lines/k04/k04-156/k04-156-06.png, 1261, 136, maid , ' she said coldly to Orsini . 
Lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-00.png, 1848, 115, The Orsini give that to traitors . There is 
Lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-01.png, 1917, 119, no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini . We hunt 
Lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-02.png, 1895, 106, a traitor down to the ends of the earth , and no 
Lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-03.png, 1950, 107, power can save him ... or her . Do you understand ? ' 
Lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-04.png, 1854, 142, ' Yes , signor , ' she faltered . ' On the other hand , ' he 
Lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-05.png, 1873, 118, continued , giving her a keen look , ' the Orsini are 
Lines/k04/k04-142/k04-142-06.png, 1801, 93, generous to those who serve them faithfully . 
Lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-00.png, 1768, 125, She had , perhaps , demanded too much . The 
Lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-01.png, 1818, 159, kiss in the garden had plumbed unsus- 
Lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-02.png, 1899, 127, pected depths in her , and she knew that 
Lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-03.png, 1988, 165, if she yielded to him , her passion could , 
Lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-04.png, 2025, 154, indeed , match his . Every instinct urged her to 
Lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-05.png, 2067, 121, surrender , for there was that in his nature 
Lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-06.png, 1972, 146, to which her own had responded as it 
Lines/k04/k04-075/k04-075-07.png, 1976, 172, had responded to no other human being . 
Lines/k04/k04-033/k04-033-00.png, 1701, 91, If the duke made any reply to this , Vittoria did 
Lines/k04/k04-033/k04-033-01.png, 1605, 93, not hear it . Now they entered the long gallery 
Lines/k04/k04-033/k04-033-02.png, 1763, 93, where they dispersed and wandered around , admiring 
Lines/k04/k04-033/k04-033-03.png, 1751, 99, and commenting on the glowing hues and barbaric 
Lines/k04/k04-033/k04-033-04.png, 1733, 103, splendours of the tapestries Doria had brought 
Lines/k04/k04-033/k04-033-05.png, 1740, 76, back from Lepanto . After a short interval , Orsini 
Lines/k04/k04-033/k04-033-06.png, 1478, 86, found an opportunity to rejoin Vittoria . 
Lines/k04/k04-033/k04-033-07.png, 1486, 91, ' We must talk further , ' he said in a low 
Lines/k04/k04-033/k04-033-08.png, 740, 87, urgent voice . ' Where ? ' 
Lines/k04/k04-017/k04-017-00.png, 1579, 155, ' Are you enjoying yourself , Olimpia ? ' she 
Lines/k04/k04-017/k04-017-01.png, 1724, 139, asked idly , tapping the girl's cheek lightly with 
Lines/k04/k04-017/k04-017-02.png, 1724, 140, her fan , in passing ; but she did not wait for 
Lines/k04/k04-017/k04-017-03.png, 1725, 126, the answer . Disturbed by vague uneasiness , she 
Lines/k04/k04-017/k04-017-04.png, 1661, 152, was wondering whether Olimpia had been 
Lines/k04/k04-017/k04-017-05.png, 1708, 129, watching her talk with Orsini . Surely she 
Lines/k04/k04-017/k04-017-06.png, 1652, 147, could not have overheard anything they 
Lines/k04/k04-017/k04-017-07.png, 1715, 160, said ? A moment's reflection reassured her 
Lines/k04/k04-017/k04-017-08.png, 1735, 137, on that point , for she was certain no one 
Lines/k04/k04-017/k04-017-09.png, 1126, 127, had been standing near them . 
Lines/k04/k04-014/k04-014-00.png, 1668, 126, The young man was bending over her with the 
Lines/k04/k04-014/k04-014-01.png, 1802, 120, assiduity of a lover , but the girl appeared to be more 
Lines/k04/k04-014/k04-014-02.png, 1809, 115, interested in her cousin's wife , whom she was regarding 
Lines/k04/k04-014/k04-014-03.png, 1753, 126, through half-closed eyes . This was a slight shock to 
Lines/k04/k04-014/k04-014-04.png, 1721, 126, Vittoria , who had forgotten the existence of the girl , 
Lines/k04/k04-014/k04-014-05.png, 1790, 121, and , up to this moment had been unaware of the 
Lines/k04/k04-014/k04-014-06.png, 1350, 135, young man's presence at the palazzo . 
Lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-00.png, 1805, 100, The sparkling society of the Doria Palace , the flattery 
Lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-01.png, 1863, 83, of Orsini's obsession , the thwarted ambitions of her 
Lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-02.png, 1951, 97, restless spirit , all threw into sharp relief the contrast 
Lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-03.png, 1895, 111, of her grey life with the splendid one that filled 
Lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-04.png, 1907, 95, her dreams . At the Villa Montalto she felt an alien , 
Lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-05.png, 1925, 194, and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco 
Lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-06.png, 1985, 99, to give her a separate establishment , he invariably 
Lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-07.png, 1902, 111, pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle , who 
Lines/k04/k04-061/k04-061-08.png, 1361, 84, had built the villa for his family . 
Lines/k04/k04-000/k04-000-00.png, 1707, 113, As he turned aside his head , since he could not 
Lines/k04/k04-000/k04-000-01.png, 1737, 126, bear to look at her beautiful , pleading face , he was 
Lines/k04/k04-000/k04-000-02.png, 1625, 111, suddenly attacked by suspicion . ' You wish to marry 
Lines/k04/k04-000/k04-000-03.png, 1635, 129, someone else ! ' he cried in a voice roughened by 
Lines/k04/k04-000/k04-000-04.png, 1769, 147, jealousy . She sighed deeply , and looked away . ' Do you ? 
Lines/k04/k04-000/k04-000-05.png, 938, 157, Do you ? ' he repeated , fiercely . 
Lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-00.png, 1814, 129, ' She is absolutely safe , ' he replied ; but he turned , 
Lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-01.png, 2001, 119, nevertheless , to the man who had peered into the 
Lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-02.png, 2036, 126, coach , whom he had addressed as Luigi , and gave him sharp 
Lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-03.png, 2129, 110, instructions on the matter . Vittoria stood looking about her , 
Lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-04.png, 2058, 128, breathing the scent of thyme . The land at her feet sloped 
Lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-05.png, 1948, 131, away into a tiny valley beyond which , on the crest 
Lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-06.png, 1952, 123, of a wooded hill-side , the ruins of a small temple 
Lines/k04/k04-163/k04-163-07.png, 1939, 126, were etched against the clear blue of the sky . 
Lines/k04/k04-039/k04-039-00.png, 1652, 114, ' Be careful , ' she whispered from behind her fan . 
Lines/k04/k04-039/k04-039-01.png, 1621, 122, ' Olimpia is watching us . The young man with her is 
Lines/k04/k04-039/k04-039-02.png, 1608, 131, Orlando Cavalcanti , Francesco's friend . ' Orsini 
Lines/k04/k04-039/k04-039-03.png, 1782, 132, shot an impatient glance at the couple . ' The young man 
Lines/k04/k04-039/k04-039-04.png, 1758, 116, with the mole ? ' ' Yes , indeed . ' ' No matter . They are not 
Lines/k04/k04-039/k04-039-05.png, 1669, 134, looking at us . Now I must know , ' he whispered , ' what 
Lines/k04/k04-039/k04-039-06.png, 1839, 120, you meant , cara mia . Do you want your freedom in order 
Lines/k04/k04-039/k04-039-07.png, 376, 126, to marry ? ' 
Lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-00.png, 1778, 200, Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat . 
Lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-01.png, 1674, 184, Thrusting his head farther into the coach , he said 
Lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-02.png, 1807, 214, sombrely : ' Have you ever heard of a punishment called 
Lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-03.png, 1775, 225, the cord ? ' She blanched and shrank away . Was there not 
Lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-04.png, 1738, 196, a street near Sant' Angelo called the Lane of the Corda 
Lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-05.png, 1820, 214, where criminals were hoisted by their wrists forty , fifty , 
Lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-06.png, 1805, 276, sixty feet into the air , and dropped again and again , until 
Lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-07.png, 1792, 167, their arms were wrenched from their sockets . ' You have 
Lines/k04/k04-136/k04-136-08.png, 437, 100, heard of it ? 
Lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-00.png, 1694, 82, Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic . The 
Lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-01.png, 1672, 73, coach now turned in another direction , towards 
Lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-02.png, 1651, 93, the wild and desolate region behind the baths . 
Lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-03.png, 1784, 104, It was sparsely inhabited , dotted with fallow fields 
Lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-04.png, 1745, 94, and terraced vineyards , and here and there jutted 
Lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-05.png, 1822, 81, a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins , a pathetic 
Lines/k04/k04-099/k04-099-06.png, 1304, 89, reminder of Rome's former greatness . 
Lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-00.png, 1715, 123, Except for their escort , Vittoria and 
Lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-01.png, 1753, 139, Lucia might have been the only living 
Lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-02.png, 1841, 133, creatures on an empty planet . After the 
Lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-03.png, 1730, 96, initial shock , Vittoria felt calm . She 
Lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-04.png, 1685, 104, knew exactly what she wanted , and 
Lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-05.png, 1910, 125, was prepared to take it without scruple , 
Lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-06.png, 1724, 170, if she could . What she had forgotten 
Lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-07.png, 1915, 112, in her self-absorption in her own schemes 
Lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-08.png, 1994, 143, was that other people were equally absorbed 
Lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-09.png, 1809, 136, in their schemes , which were likely to 
Lines/k04/k04-110/k04-110-10.png, 1388, 90, run counter to her own . 
Lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-00.png, 1734, 91, In this region of Monti most of the public baths 
Lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-01.png, 1779, 79, had been built in the time of the Caesars , but with the 
Lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-02.png, 1790, 95, breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions 
Lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-03.png, 1709, 84, the baths had lost their purpose ; they had become 
Lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-04.png, 1776, 74, stone quarries and their precious marble had been 
Lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-05.png, 1813, 77, burnt for lime . Now escaped criminals and bandits 
Lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-06.png, 1799, 92, used these quarries as hiding places , to the danger 
Lines/k04/k04-103/k04-103-07.png, 912, 67, of travellers in the district . 
Lines/k04/k04-106/k04-106-00.png, 1807, 145, As they lumbered past at a rattling pace , Vittoria 
Lines/k04/k04-106/k04-106-01.png, 1906, 130, could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a 
Lines/k04/k04-106/k04-106-02.png, 1891, 123, gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures 
Lines/k04/k04-106/k04-106-03.png, 1844, 149, gathered about it , cooking their frugal meal . These 
Lines/k04/k04-106/k04-106-04.png, 1899, 137, were left far behind . An old man belabouring an 
Lines/k04/k04-106/k04-106-05.png, 1826, 99, overladen donkey , and a withered crone appeared 
Lines/k04/k04-106/k04-106-06.png, 1587, 140, on the horizon , were overtaken and forgotten . 
Lines/k04/k04-057/k04-057-00.png, 1828, 105, Vittoria , accompanied by her maid , Lucia , was on her 
Lines/k04/k04-057/k04-057-01.png, 1803, 97, way to the Accoramboni villa , ostensibly to pay 
Lines/k04/k04-057/k04-057-02.png, 1850, 106, a daughterly call on her father , actually to coax 
Lines/k04/k04-057/k04-057-03.png, 1967, 99, money from that indulgent parent to settle her mounting 
Lines/k04/k04-057/k04-057-04.png, 1822, 110, debts . Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress 
Lines/k04/k04-057/k04-057-05.png, 1817, 105, looked , and how cunningly the olive-green dress 
Lines/k04/k04-057/k04-057-06.png, 1838, 82, with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her 
Lines/k04/k04-057/k04-057-07.png, 1692, 121, perfect figure . Vittoria's thoughts were more complex . 
Lines/k04/k04-064/k04-064-00.png, 1698, 99, He reminded her that they must abide by Roman 
Lines/k04/k04-064/k04-064-01.png, 1712, 81, custom , and dwell there with their relations . Her 
Lines/k04/k04-064/k04-064-02.png, 1717, 56, values were those of the materialist who assesses 
Lines/k04/k04-064/k04-064-03.png, 1750, 85, every human being in terms of fame , power and 
Lines/k04/k04-064/k04-064-04.png, 1764, 85, wealth . Francesco she despised for his dullness , his 
Lines/k04/k04-064/k04-064-05.png, 1714, 68, lack of initiative , his subservience to his uncle . 
Lines/k04/k04-119/k04-119-00.png, 1787, 132, The moment had come . Upon the ensuing interview 
Lines/k04/k04-119/k04-119-01.png, 1888, 112, the future would depend . Outwardly she was calm , but 
Lines/k04/k04-119/k04-119-02.png, 1802, 137, her heart was beating fast , and the palms of her 
Lines/k04/k04-119/k04-119-03.png, 1806, 123, hands were damp . Orsini's high-crowned hat with 
Lines/k04/k04-119/k04-119-04.png, 1819, 129, its jaunty plume blotted out the light ; his hand 
Lines/k04/k04-119/k04-119-05.png, 1775, 136, was on the door . Glancing at Lucia he said in 
Lines/k04/k04-119/k04-119-06.png, 1834, 97, French to Vittoria : ' Your maid ... is she reliable ? ' 
Lines/k04/k04-005/k04-005-00.png, 1936, 103, ' If , ' she said gently , giving him a look that set his pulses throbbing , 
Lines/k04/k04-005/k04-005-01.png, 1941, 108, ' if I wished to marry some young gallant , do you think I would 
Lines/k04/k04-005/k04-005-02.png, 2053, 104, ask your help ? You would be the last man I would ask . ' Before 
Lines/k04/k04-005/k04-005-03.png, 2006, 116, he could collect his wits to reply to this , there was a bustle 
Lines/k04/k04-005/k04-005-04.png, 1956, 96, and confusion at the end of the room . Prince Doria had 
Lines/k04/k04-005/k04-005-05.png, 1958, 128, wearied of his toy and was packing it away in its painted 
Lines/k04/k04-005/k04-005-06.png, 200, 55, coffer . 
Lines/k04/k04-028/k04-028-00.png, 1634, 85, I like to think it may have fallen from the dark 
Lines/k04/k04-028/k04-028-01.png, 1654, 78, hair of the Empress Messalina , as she crouched 
Lines/k04/k04-028/k04-028-02.png, 1636, 97, in terror in the gardens of Lucullus , awaiting the 
Lines/k04/k04-028/k04-028-03.png, 1687, 78, sword of the executioner . ' ' Ah ! ' exclaimed 
Lines/k04/k04-028/k04-028-04.png, 1553, 93, Farnese , with a snigger . ' The old cuckold 
Lines/k04/k04-028/k04-028-05.png, 1599, 68, Claudius had the last word , after all . He 
Lines/k04/k04-028/k04-028-06.png, 1674, 61, knew how to deal with an adulterous wife , 
Lines/k04/k04-028/k04-028-07.png, 389, 63, eh , Orsini ? ' 
Lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-00.png, 1884, 117, This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a 
Lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-01.png, 1923, 115, sickening jolt and came to an abrupt stop , nearly throwing 
Lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-02.png, 1851, 123, the two girls from their seats . Lucia uttered a cry of 
Lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-03.png, 1858, 131, alarm . ' Look , madonna , we are surrounded ! ' It was true . 
Lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-04.png, 1841, 137, Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about 
Lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-05.png, 1806, 141, them and a lean , swarthy fellow was peering through 
Lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-06.png, 1725, 112, the window , grinning impudently . ' Santa Maria ! ' 
Lines/k04/k04-085/k04-085-07.png, 1023, 91, shrieked Lucia . ' Banditti ! ' 
Lines/k04/k04-010/k04-010-00.png, 1772, 146, The party was now preparing to see 
Lines/k04/k04-010/k04-010-01.png, 1699, 126, the tapestries , and in the general 
Lines/k04/k04-010/k04-010-02.png, 1802, 114, movement , Vittoria was separated from 
Lines/k04/k04-010/k04-010-03.png, 1619, 117, Orsini . Although neither of them 
Lines/k04/k04-010/k04-010-04.png, 1782, 134, wished to follow the sightseers , there seemed 
Lines/k04/k04-010/k04-010-05.png, 1768, 88, no alternative . As she was about to mount 
Lines/k04/k04-010/k04-010-06.png, 1720, 134, a wide and shallow flight of marble 
Lines/k04/k04-010/k04-010-07.png, 1696, 134, stairs , she became aware of someone 
Lines/k04/k04-010/k04-010-08.png, 1775, 151, watching her intently , and turning 
Lines/k04/k04-010/k04-010-09.png, 1836, 125, in that direction , she saw Olimpia , 
Lines/k04/k04-010/k04-010-10.png, 1918, 132, standing beside her admirer , Orlando Cavalcanti . 
Lines/k04/k04-022/k04-022-00.png, 1709, 113, However , something inimical in the girl's look 
Lines/k04/k04-022/k04-022-01.png, 1770, 151, put Vittoria on guard . ' Santa Maria ! These spying 
Lines/k04/k04-022/k04-022-02.png, 1711, 157, eyes ! ' she thought , bitterly . Doria was continually 
Lines/k04/k04-022/k04-022-03.png, 1866, 131, stopping on the way , to point out , with childish pride , 
Lines/k04/k04-022/k04-022-04.png, 1756, 124, objects of beauty or interest . Vittoria , on the 
Lines/k04/k04-022/k04-022-05.png, 1628, 128, fringe of the party , caught snatches of this 
Lines/k04/k04-022/k04-022-06.png, 1690, 136, information , which held no interest for her : 
Lines/k04/k04-022/k04-022-07.png, 1043, 128, ' ... now this sapphire ... 
Lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-00.png, 1845, 132, This move today was a reminder of that fact . 
Lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-01.png, 1783, 132, Whilst she automatically patted the hand of 
Lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-02.png, 1709, 120, the agitated Lucia , her brain was working 
Lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-03.png, 1715, 104, rapidly , and she decided that she must be 
Lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-04.png, 1789, 92, prepared to counter Orsini's demands , 
Lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-05.png, 1845, 154, difficult though that would be . She became 
Lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-06.png, 1817, 119, aware that the pace was slackening ; 
Lines/k04/k04-115/k04-115-07.png, 1214, 105, now the coach stopped . 
Lines/k04/k04-149/k04-149-00.png, 1756, 114, Remember that , my girl . ' Lucia was beyond 
Lines/k04/k04-149/k04-149-01.png, 1861, 111, speech . He turned to Vittoria , sitting erect , 
Lines/k04/k04-149/k04-149-02.png, 1848, 101, with flushed cheeks and eyes sparkling with 
Lines/k04/k04-149/k04-149-03.png, 1919, 111, anger . ' And now , madonna , ' he said smoothly , ' we will 
Lines/k04/k04-149/k04-149-04.png, 1787, 100, continue the conversation started at the Doria 
Lines/k04/k04-149/k04-149-05.png, 1825, 128, Palace . Be pleased to alight . ' ' I think , ' she replied 
Lines/k04/k04-149/k04-149-06.png, 1379, 102, coolly , ' I prefer to stay where I am . ' 
Lines/k04/k04-054/k04-054-00.png, 1696, 104, With a swift gesture she closed her fan 
Lines/k04/k04-054/k04-054-01.png, 1875, 106, and moved away from him towards the group 
Lines/k04/k04-054/k04-054-02.png, 1926, 114, in the centre of the gallery , leaving him standing 
Lines/k04/k04-054/k04-054-03.png, 1831, 93, alone , against that glowing , barbaric background , 
Lines/k04/k04-054/k04-054-04.png, 1862, 101, with a deeply thoughtful expression on his face . 
Lines/k04/k04-054/k04-054-05.png, 1931, 108, On a bright unclouded morning a few days after 
Lines/k04/k04-054/k04-054-06.png, 1828, 84, the visit to the Doria Palace , the cardinal's 
Lines/k04/k04-054/k04-054-07.png, 1781, 114, coach left the villa , lurched over the unpaved 
Lines/k04/k04-054/k04-054-08.png, 1874, 71, track and turned towards the ruined Baths 
Lines/k04/k04-054/k04-054-09.png, 559, 78, of Diocletian . 
Lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-00.png, 1808, 111, Her husband's gentleness and amiability , his unselfish 
Lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-01.png, 1834, 80, love for her , she regarded as signs of weakness . He was a 
Lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-02.png, 1827, 73, futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving 
Lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-03.png, 1833, 73, her a child . Whatever passion she had experienced in the 
Lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-04.png, 1823, 74, first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt . 
Lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-05.png, 1753, 97, She had never loved him . Her thoughts rushed to Orsini . 
Lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-06.png, 1746, 89, Since the meeting in the Doria Palace , no word had 
Lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-07.png, 1743, 94, come from him , and this silence oppressed her spirits 
Lines/k04/k04-068/k04-068-08.png, 971, 82, with a weight of misgiving . 
Lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-00.png, 1827, 113, Vittoria now realized that they were outside 
Lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-01.png, 1911, 119, Santa Maria degli Angeli , and that except for a few beggars 
Lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-02.png, 1670, 128, crouching in the doorway of the church and exhibiting 
Lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-03.png, 1948, 117, loathsome sores , the area was deserted . ' They are not banditti , 
Lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-04.png, 1744, 114, Lucia , ' said Vittoria , pointing to the badge on the man's 
Lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-05.png, 1655, 102, shoulder . The words were clear . ' Beware my hug ! ' Lucia 
Lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-06.png, 1816, 146, stared speechlessly at the golden bear ; Vittoria swiftly 
Lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-07.png, 1848, 86, averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance 
Lines/k04/k04-093/k04-093-08.png, 607, 62, of the retainer . 
Lines/j07/j07-005/j07-005-00.png, 1671, 115, The air passages were packed with corrugated 
Lines/j07/j07-005/j07-005-01.png, 1513, 128, foil bonded to the primary plates to 
Lines/j07/j07-005/j07-005-02.png, 1702, 111, provide the necessary surface area for heat transfer . 
Lines/j07/j07-005/j07-005-03.png, 1839, 131, The narrower coolant passages were also packed with foil , 
Lines/j07/j07-005/j07-005-04.png, 2270, 152, chiefly to provide sufficient support for the flat plates to withstand 
Lines/j07/j07-005/j07-005-05.png, 1986, 128, the coolant pressure loadings . The introduction of the aluminium alloy 
Lines/j07/j07-005/j07-005-06.png, 2034, 139, dip-brazing process in the early 1940's was quickly taken up 
Lines/j07/j07-005/j07-005-07.png, 1963, 140, for aircraft heat exchangers and led to substantial 
Lines/j07/j07-005/j07-005-08.png, 1974, 137, weight reductions as compared with copper construction . 
Lines/j07/j07-012/j07-012-00.png, 1726, 89, Furthermore , developments in the detail form of 
Lines/j07/j07-012/j07-012-01.png, 1628, 88, the fins made possible a reduction in the total 
Lines/j07/j07-012/j07-012-02.png, 1813, 85, surface area required as compared with the use of 
Lines/j07/j07-012/j07-012-03.png, 1783, 96, smooth continuous passages for the same thermal 
Lines/j07/j07-012/j07-012-04.png, 1673, 107, duty and pressure losses . The properties of 
Lines/j07/j07-012/j07-012-05.png, 1844, 98, compact form , low weight , and design flexibility 
Lines/j07/j07-012/j07-012-06.png, 1665, 107, thus developed found ready application on a 
Lines/j07/j07-012/j07-012-07.png, 1840, 89, much larger scale with the introduction of tonnage 
Lines/j07/j07-012/j07-012-08.png, 1059, 88, scale air separation plants . 
Lines/j07/j07-009/j07-009-00.png, 1617, 80, This development coincided with the introduction of 
Lines/j07/j07-009/j07-009-01.png, 1827, 76, pressurized aircraft cabins and the demand for air-to-air 
Lines/j07/j07-009/j07-009-02.png, 1797, 79, cabin coolers . Although in this case the heat transfer 
Lines/j07/j07-009/j07-009-03.png, 1725, 85, coefficients on the two sides of the heat exchanger 
Lines/j07/j07-009/j07-009-04.png, 1588, 89, were of comparable magnitude , the use of 
Lines/j07/j07-009/j07-009-05.png, 1743, 92, secondary surface was still attractive , since the 
Lines/j07/j07-009/j07-009-06.png, 1829, 84, greater part of the surface area could be made up 
Lines/j07/j07-009/j07-009-07.png, 1529, 92, of fins only 0.006 in. ( 0.15 mm. ) thick . 
Lines/j07/j07-000/j07-000-00.png, 1798, 87, This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be 
Lines/j07/j07-000/j07-000-01.png, 1698, 77, obtained with tubular constructions . The growth of the 
Lines/j07/j07-000/j07-000-02.png, 1866, 86, aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need 
Lines/j07/j07-000/j07-000-03.png, 1919, 93, for lightweight compact heat exchangers . During the 1930's , 
Lines/j07/j07-000/j07-000-04.png, 1874, 86, the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction 
Lines/j07/j07-000/j07-000-05.png, 1701, 88, became established for aero-engine radiators , using 
Lines/j07/j07-000/j07-000-06.png, 1932, 87, dip-soldered copper . The air and engine-coolant passages 
Lines/j07/j07-000/j07-000-07.png, 1032, 78, were separated by flat plates . 
Lines/j07/j07-015/j07-015-00.png, 1849, 84, The basic method of construction is both simple and 
Lines/j07/j07-015/j07-015-01.png, 1581, 94, extremely flexible . Figure 3 illustrates the

Lines/g02/g02-062/g02-062-02.png, 1850, 89, the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the

Lines/g02/g02-062/g02-062-05.png, 1687, 108, the dissections of living animals , Harvey noted that 
Lines/g02/g02-062/g02-062-06.png, 1857, 95, contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in 
Lines/g02/g02-062/g02-062-07.png, 1857, 95, systole , simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries 
Lines/g02/g02-062/g02-062-08.png, 1805, 93, and of the artery-like vein , and expulsion of the 
Lines/g02/g02-062/g02-062-09.png, 762, 67, ventricular content . 
Lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-00.png, 1710, 130, In Chapter Two he gauged the nature of the heart's movements 
Lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-01.png, 1731, 154, from the dissection of living animals , showing how these move- 
Lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-02.png, 1706, 75, ments alternate with rests and are seen best in cold animals 
Lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-03.png, 1691, 139, or in flagging warmer ones . At the time of its movement 
Lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-04.png, 1743, 133, the heart becomes generally constricted , its walls thicken , 
Lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-05.png, 1496, 102, its ventricles decrease in volume and it expels its 
Lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-06.png, 1689, 148, content of blood , appearing paler in so doing in animals 
Lines/g02/g02-059/g02-059-07.png, 1155, 129, such as serpents , frogs , and the like . 
Lines/g02/g02-065/g02-065-00.png, 1659, 144, Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of 
Lines/g02/g02-065/g02-065-01.png, 1807, 132, ventricular contraction . During cutting or puncture of 
Lines/g02/g02-065/g02-065-02.png, 1817, 121, the ventricles , there is often forcible expulsion 
Lines/g02/g02-065/g02-065-03.png, 1770, 131, of blood from the wound . Arterial diastole is 
Lines/g02/g02-065/g02-065-04.png, 1762, 116, thus synchronous with cardiac systole but , 
Lines/g02/g02-065/g02-065-05.png, 1774, 140, when movement of blood through arteries is 
Lines/g02/g02-065/g02-065-06.png, 1817, 124, hindered by compression , infarction or inter- 
Lines/g02/g02-065/g02-065-07.png, 1705, 122, ception , the more distal arteries pulsate 
Lines/g02/g02-065/g02-065-08.png, 1725, 118, less because their pulse is nothing other 
Lines/g02/g02-065/g02-065-09.png, 1857, 107, than the impulse of the blood entering them . 
Lines/k02/k02-093/k02-093-00.png, 1568, 84, Knowing Nigel , I would have been surprised if he 
Lines/k02/k02-093/k02-093-01.png, 1715, 104, had not made his usual ' arrangements ' . A bachelor 
Lines/k02/k02-093/k02-093-02.png, 1590, 85, himself , he knew well how to entertain his bachelor 
Lines/k02/k02-093/k02-093-03.png, 1625, 108, friends . He caught my look and pursed his lips in 
Lines/k02/k02-093/k02-093-04.png, 1707, 101, a quick little grimace of acknowledgement ; then raised 
Lines/k02/k02-093/k02-093-05.png, 1551, 97, an enquiring eyebrow in young Lee's direction . 
Lines/k02/k02-053/k02-053-00.png, 1698, 139, I slept soundly , and much later than I should . It 
Lines/k02/k02-053/k02-053-01.png, 1671, 139, was already after six when I awoke , and the sun 
Lines/k02/k02-053/k02-053-02.png, 1660, 148, was nearly setting beyond the west window . 
Lines/k02/k02-053/k02-053-03.png, 1688, 117, Downstairs I could hear the murmur of voices , 
Lines/k02/k02-053/k02-053-04.png, 1582, 155, and knew they were back . I wondered , as I 
Lines/k02/k02-053/k02-053-05.png, 1502, 132, wrapped a 6sarong around my waist , if 
Lines/k02/k02-053/k02-053-06.png, 1567, 150, Nigel at all resented being deprived of his 
Lines/k02/k02-053/k02-053-07.png, 549, 139, afternoon sleep . 
Lines/k02/k02-036/k02-036-00.png, 1732, 144, ' Not at all . I 'll show you . ' ' Oh no , ' 
Lines/k02/k02-036/k02-036-01.png, 1740, 126, young Lee protested , considerate as always . 
Lines/k02/k02-036/k02-036-02.png, 1780, 124, ' That 's not necessary if you want to rest , sir . 
Lines/k02/k02-036/k02-036-03.png, 1630, 125, I 'm sure I won't do any harm . ' Nigel 
Lines/k02/k02-036/k02-036-04.png, 1733, 117, laughed . I had not known he was so 
Lines/k02/k02-036/k02-036-05.png, 1757, 116, good-natured . But then , I suppose I had 
Lines/k02/k02-036/k02-036-06.png, 1784, 134, never given him similar cause to display 
Lines/k02/k02-036/k02-036-07.png, 663, 133, such amiability . 
Lines/k02/k02-112/k02-112-00.png, 1702, 88, He had one of the better Kashmir carpets on 
Lines/k02/k02-112/k02-112-01.png, 1722, 99, the floor . His pictures and curtains , indeed I 
Lines/k02/k02-112/k02-112-02.png, 1750, 103, suppose the entire furnishings , had been se- 
Lines/k02/k02-112/k02-112-03.png, 1524, 106, lected personally . The house was , as he 
Lines/k02/k02-112/k02-112-04.png, 1774, 105, occasionally proclaimed , his home - and he had 
Lines/k02/k02-112/k02-112-05.png, 1690, 78, made it as such . I doubt if he will ever 
Lines/k02/k02-112/k02-112-06.png, 1512, 130, leave Malaya , even when he retires . 
Lines/k02/k02-076/k02-076-00.png, 1504, 128, Perhaps Lee wasn't quite as 
Lines/k02/k02-076/k02-076-01.png, 1705, 133, reserved as I thought . ' Thanks , 
Lines/k02/k02-076/k02-076-02.png, 1714, 141, Nigel , ' he said . ' Just Coca-Cola . 
Lines/k02/k02-076/k02-076-03.png, 1414, 147, Although I 'd like to have 
Lines/k02/k02-076/k02-076-04.png, 1714, 122, whatever you have . I want to 
Lines/k02/k02-076/k02-076-05.png, 1692, 141, get to know the kind of life 
Lines/k02/k02-076/k02-076-06.png, 1917, 131, people lead in the East , you know . ' 
Lines/k02/k02-076/k02-076-07.png, 1740, 119, At this , I felt a return of the 
Lines/k02/k02-076/k02-076-08.png, 1560, 132, irritation I felt with him 
Lines/k02/k02-076/k02-076-09.png, 536, 81, at times . 
Lines/k02/k02-067/k02-067-00.png, 1837, 140, ' We 've just had tea , ' Nigel said . ' Would you like 
Lines/k02/k02-067/k02-067-01.png, 1767, 141, the cookie to make you a fresh lot ? ' ' I 'd rather 
Lines/k02/k02-067/k02-067-02.png, 1737, 150, have whisky , ' I told him . ' Thought as much . 
Lines/k02/k02-067/k02-067-03.png, 1548, 141, Sun 's nearly below the yard-arm , anyway . 
Lines/k02/k02-067/k02-067-04.png, 1730, 136, Wouldn't mind a stengah myself . How about 
Lines/k02/k02-067/k02-067-05.png, 1710, 159, you , Harry ? ' So they had managed to come 
Lines/k02/k02-067/k02-067-06.png, 1671, 144, to the stage of using each other's Christian 
Lines/k02/k02-067/k02-067-07.png, 616, 117, names , I noted . 
Lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-00.png, 1685, 96, There was still an ease in our conversation , but its 
Lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-01.png, 1676, 93, scope was restricted . I felt that I could hardly make the 
Lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-02.png, 1785, 89, usual enquiries and comments about Nigel's various mistresses 
Lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-03.png, 1711, 89, as I was accustomed to whenever I saw him , much as I 
Lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-04.png, 1800, 92, wondered which of his girls was in favour at the moment . 
Lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-05.png, 1778, 105, And I suppose he felt the same . We had only a few drinks , 
Lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-06.png, 1649, 99, then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early 
Lines/k02/k02-102/k02-102-07.png, 192, 52, dinner . 
Lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-00.png, 1782, 166, And I said to myself : Oh , God , doesn't the

Lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-02.png, 1713, 182, from me almost instantly , but it had 
Lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-03.png, 1797, 196, been enough to make me conscious of the 
Lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-04.png, 1855, 172, nakedness of the upper half of my body , even 
Lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-05.png, 1708, 190, of the matted grey hairs on my chest . He 
Lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-06.png, 2047, 171, probably thought my appearance quite a breach 
Lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-07.png, 1914, 169, of the social graces ; but , naturally , he said 
Lines/k02/k02-062/k02-062-08.png, 1430, 94, not so much as a word about it . 
Lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-00.png, 1614, 111, I shrugged a shoulder . Lee would have 
Lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-01.png, 1612, 110, to decide about that for himself , I 
Lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-02.png, 1722, 134, thought , and noticed that although he 
Lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-03.png, 1721, 134, was looking at the other girl , he did 
Lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-04.png, 1836, 132, so quite dispassionately , almost as though 
Lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-05.png, 1891, 136, he was merely interested in the unfamiliar 
Lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-06.png, 1841, 144, clothes she was wearing . And I thought 
Lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-07.png, 1836, 155, to myself : He may be still too much of 
Lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-08.png, 1730, 146, a ' new chum ' to see ' the beauty of 
Lines/k02/k02-097/k02-097-09.png, 416, 97, the East ' . 
Lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-00.png, 1746, 109, The gin pahits , and now the beer with the 
Lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-01.png, 1729, 98, curry , had their desired effect on us ; 
Lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-02.png, 1773, 105, or rather , on Nigel and myself . Lee , I 
Lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-03.png, 1755, 85, noticed , had asked for Coca-Cola . This 
Lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-04.png, 1789, 111, rather surprised me from a young man 
Lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-05.png, 1748, 92, who was otherwise so sophisticated . He 
Lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-06.png, 1687, 85, was not , however , ostentatious about 
Lines/k02/k02-018/k02-018-07.png, 477, 61, the matter . 
Lines/k02/k02-029/k02-029-00.png, 1755, 96, Lee , however , showed not the slightest sign of fatigue . ' I 
Lines/k02/k02-029/k02-029-01.png, 1755, 88, wonder if you 'd mind if I took a bit of a look round , ' 
Lines/k02/k02-029/k02-029-02.png, 1780, 89, he asked Nigel . ' I don't sleep in the afternoons . ' Nigel , 
Lines/k02/k02-029/k02-029-03.png, 1731, 85, I must say , was very good about it . I knew how much 
Lines/k02/k02-029/k02-029-04.png, 1661, 85, he probably wanted to sleep himself . But , almost 
Lines/k02/k02-029/k02-029-05.png, 625, 77, gallantly , he said : 
Lines/k02/k02-023/k02-023-00.png, 1778, 129, If anything , he had merely become a little more reserved , and 
Lines/k02/k02-023/k02-023-01.png, 1795, 136, much more polite . I thought to myself : ' A few years in the 
Lines/k02/k02-023/k02-023-02.png, 1740, 126, East , my boy , and you 'll drink - I 've seen your kind be- 
Lines/k02/k02-023/k02-023-03.png, 1709, 144, fore ! ' After the curry , I wanted only to go upstairs to 
Lines/k02/k02-023/k02-023-04.png, 1782, 124, bed . I had long since become accustomed , and now addicted , 
Lines/k02/k02-023/k02-023-05.png, 672, 130, to an after-curry nap .

Lines/k02/k02-117/k02-117-01.png, 1820, 172, to mean too much to him . And , indirectly , 
Lines/k02/k02-117/k02-117-02.png, 1906, 181, this impression I had of him was one of several 
Lines/k02/k02-117/k02-117-03.png, 1883, 265, reasons why I had decided I should leave 
Lines/k02/k02-117/k02-117-04.png, 1921, 179, it - before , for me too , it would be too late . 
Lines/k02/k02-117/k02-117-05.png, 1873, 200, I used the excuse of our early start in the 
Lines/k02/k02-117/k02-117-06.png, 1747, 171, morning to retire as soon as it seemed 
Lines/k02/k02-117/k02-117-07.png, 1914, 162, prudent to do so , after the coffee and brandy , 
Lines/k02/k02-117/k02-117-08.png, 1854, 212, already anticipating the familiar pleasures 
Lines/k02/k02-117/k02-117-09.png, 675, 128, awaiting me .

Lines/m02/m02-102/m02-102-02.png, 1707, 121, and their filing clerks . The students had 
Lines/m02/m02-102/m02-102-03.png, 1855, 142, bought their college education forward and 
Lines/m02/m02-102/m02-102-04.png, 1761, 123, were now being bought forward in their 
Lines/m02/m02-102/m02-102-05.png, 1758, 142, turn . By comparing personal appearances 
Lines/m02/m02-102/m02-102-06.png, 1758, 153, with university records , the agents of the 
Lines/m02/m02-102/m02-102-07.png, 1674, 155, businesses would pick on young men 
Lines/m02/m02-102/m02-102-08.png, 1858, 94, and women who interested them , and contracts 
Lines/m02/m02-102/m02-102-09.png, 1687, 104, would be initialled at the end of

Lines/m02/m02-075/m02-075-03.png, 1905, 130, Back-Face area ) the cry would go up , 
Lines/m02/m02-075/m02-075-04.png, 1736, 125, as soon as he had spoken a few 
Lines/m02/m02-075/m02-075-05.png, 1671, 131, sentences of his speech : ' Cut the

Lines/m02/m02-112/m02-112-02.png, 1929, 87, Mos have an un-American love of parades , and 
Lines/m02/m02-112/m02-112-03.png, 1893, 112, these young ones , on parade for jobs which they 
Lines/m02/m02-112/m02-112-04.png, 1870, 111, had to get to pay off their college bills , were naturally

Lines/m02/m02-090/m02-090-09.png, 1924, 114, ( or to Moke ) , there was a vacuum where there should

Lines/m02/m02-095/m02-095-01.png, 1844, 91, like a masquerade of business interests in dis- 
Lines/m02/m02-095/m02-095-02.png, 1908, 105, guise which , far from attracting the allegiance 
Lines/m02/m02-095/m02-095-03.png, 1905, 110, of free men everywhere , could only repel them . 
Lines/m02/m02-095/m02-095-04.png, 1872, 100, Then what of the cultural life ? Did this per- 
Lines/m02/m02-095/m02-095-05.png, 1979, 136, haps nurture a genuinely civilizing impulse 
Lines/m02/m02-095/m02-095-06.png, 1785, 98, which might in time become social fact 
Lines/m02/m02-095/m02-095-07.png, 1990, 81, and counteract the obsession with economics 
Lines/m02/m02-095/m02-095-08.png, 1845, 133, which had grown up during the Moon's

Lines/m02/m02-052/m02-052-00.png, 1838, 124, The recovery of his balance was due to the

Lines/m02/m02-052/m02-052-04.png, 1854, 88, lucky to have descended from such economic altitudes . 
Lines/m02/m02-052/m02-052-05.png, 1992, 121, Tom Dreyfus had a job on the machines in the Secretariat

Lines/m02/m02-066/m02-066-02.png, 1784, 149, sphere of the sun . A matter which on Earth would hardly 
Lines/m02/m02-066/m02-066-03.png, 1724, 149, penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general 
Lines/m02/m02-066/m02-066-04.png, 1775, 142, interest to the Mos , doubtless because their habitat is 
Lines/m02/m02-066/m02-066-05.png, 1668, 157, not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere . 
Lines/m02/m02-106/m02-106-00.png, 1796, 107, But since starting salaries would depend on grade A

Lines/m02/m02-106/m02-106-03.png, 1758, 123, these fine young people was closely geared to 
Lines/m02/m02-106/m02-106-04.png, 1808, 147, economic and biological ends which , essentially , 
Lines/m02/m02-106/m02-106-05.png, 1759, 133, were really means . So , seeing them revolve in 
Lines/m02/m02-106/m02-106-06.png, 1855, 155, circles , Harry had the feeling that Moke ( or what 
Lines/m02/m02-106/m02-106-07.png, 1883, 165, Moke consciously or unconsciously symbolised , any- 
Lines/m02/m02-106/m02-106-08.png, 1842, 166, way in Harry's mind ) had these splendid young 
Lines/m02/m02-106/m02-106-09.png, 2004, 121, people by the short hairs , and was diverting them ... 
Lines/m02/m02-069/m02-069-00.png, 1752, 135, One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might 
Lines/m02/m02-069/m02-069-01.png, 1830, 116, with time instil the reverence which , on Earth , nature inspires , 
Lines/m02/m02-069/m02-069-02.png, 1832, 108, especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's 
Lines/m02/m02-069/m02-069-03.png, 1794, 145, Board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the 
Lines/m02/m02-069/m02-069-04.png, 1853, 144, solar system . True enough , such ultimate weapons had not been 
Lines/m02/m02-069/m02-069-05.png, 1871, 147, used in the last few wars , but it seemed very probable 
Lines/m02/m02-069/m02-069-06.png, 1827, 115, that they would be in the next one , Moon and her 
Lines/m02/m02-069/m02-069-07.png, 1846, 154, allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the

Lines/m02/m02-109/m02-109-00.png, 1762, 152, Stepping out in their white shorts , they looked glad enough 
Lines/m02/m02-109/m02-109-01.png, 1844, 160, to be diverted , however , with the single exception of one 
Lines/m02/m02-109/m02-109-02.png, 1749, 183, worried little man-student who kept getting out of 
Lines/m02/m02-109/m02-109-03.png, 1674, 177, step . He looked as if nothing Moke and his 
Lines/m02/m02-109/m02-109-04.png, 1725, 70, minions could do to him would ever make him 
Lines/m02/m02-109/m02-109-05.png, 1752, 154, GO ; but the reason probably lay in elementary 
Lines/m02/m02-109/m02-109-06.png, 1792, 128, neurosis and not in some eruption from those 
Lines/m02/m02-109/m02-109-07.png, 1844, 152, deeper layers in the human psyche which are

Lines/b01/b01-062/b01-062-01.png, 1700, 140, This is a difficult question . It would obviously 
Lines/b01/b01-062/b01-062-02.png, 1799, 131, be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with 
Lines/b01/b01-062/b01-062-03.png, 1636, 133, which we disagree . When an advertisement 
Lines/b01/b01-062/b01-062-04.png, 1559, 116, contains statements whose factual truth is 
Lines/b01/b01-062/b01-062-05.png, 1656, 122, doubtful , or where the total content would be 
Lines/b01/b01-062/b01-062-06.png, 1682, 144, deeply repugnant to our readers , it is right to 
Lines/b01/b01-062/b01-062-07.png, 1478, 100, exercise editorial discretion . The MRA 
Lines/b01/b01-062/b01-062-08.png, 1718, 140, advertisement falls into neither category , though 
Lines/b01/b01-062/b01-062-09.png, 1155, 138, many readers will dislike it . 
Lines/b01/b01-023/b01-023-00.png, 1704, 152, Seen in this wider picture , a South Africa that clings to 
Lines/b01/b01-023/b01-023-01.png, 1677, 106, apartheid is a menace to the Commonwealth and a 
Lines/b01/b01-023/b01-023-02.png, 1578, 181, liability to the whole Western world . A practical 
Lines/b01/b01-023/b01-023-03.png, 1729, 116, solution would be for the Commonwealth to draft 
Lines/b01/b01-023/b01-023-04.png, 1697, 149, a set of principles excluding race discrimination . 
Lines/b01/b01-023/b01-023-05.png, 1636, 186, And so leave South Africa to make the grade ,

Lines/b01/b01-009/b01-009-00.png, 1633, 103, The Archbishop has long been a courageous 
Lines/b01/b01-009/b01-009-01.png, 1615, 89, fighter against apartheid . He must be heard 
Lines/b01/b01-009/b01-009-02.png, 1725, 88, with attention . On purely practical grounds he 
Lines/b01/b01-009/b01-009-03.png, 1702, 71, holds that it would be a mistake to expel

Lines/b01/b01-049/b01-049-02.png, 1736, 106, the strength of Germany's trading position has attracted 
Lines/b01/b01-049/b01-049-03.png, 1769, 108, speculators to hold marks rather than pounds or dollars , 
Lines/b01/b01-049/b01-049-04.png, 1727, 121, hoping for the mark to rise , as has now happened .

Lines/b01/b01-118/b01-118-06.png, 1741, 170, led a protest against admitting any of them 
Lines/b01/b01-118/b01-118-07.png, 1720, 129, because they would " defile " the national

Lines/b01/b01-073/b01-073-05.png, 1679, 61, understood . The Sudan's concern for its

Lines/p02/p02-109/p02-109-08.png, 1415, 146, him a great deal better than you do . " 
Lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-00.png, 1794, 144, His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of 
Lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-01.png, 1819, 158, taste but it was unkind beyond words . She fumbled 
Lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-02.png, 1814, 139, with the cigarette packet which lay on the table 
Lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-03.png, 1830, 146, not wanting to smoke but needing some action 
Lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-04.png, 1823, 152, to help her control her feelings . " Come and 
Lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-05.png, 1707, 159, dance , " Doc's cheery voice came as a 
Lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-06.png, 1870, 191, lifeline and Gay got up quickly , mana- 
Lines/p02/p02-101/p02-101-07.png, 716, 174, ging a smile . 
Lines/p02/p02-000/p02-000-00.png, 1816, 98, There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was 
Lines/p02/p02-000/p02-000-01.png, 1782, 119, quickly through the customs . " Gay ! " " Gavin ! " The girl 
Lines/p02/p02-000/p02-000-02.png, 1812, 108, and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone 
Lines/p02/p02-000/p02-000-03.png, 1811, 118, together . The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the 
Lines/p02/p02-000/p02-000-04.png, 1720, 119, taxi . " Just a moment , darling , " Gavin pressed her 
Lines/p02/p02-000/p02-000-05.png, 1623, 105, hand and smiled . " I want to check up on the 
Lines/p02/p02-000/p02-000-06.png, 475, 113, flights back . " 
Lines/p02/p02-150/p02-150-00.png, 1784, 69, Because she was second best . The others came back 
Lines/p02/p02-150/p02-150-01.png, 1936, 90, to the table , all of them making a fuss of her and at once 
Lines/p02/p02-150/p02-150-02.png, 1900, 98, she felt happier . Gay loved them for their warm sympathy , 
Lines/p02/p02-150/p02-150-03.png, 1988, 95, knowing that they were real friends , even if they were new ones . 
Lines/p02/p02-150/p02-150-04.png, 1858, 150, " That is a pretty dress , " Lilyan commented , obviously sensing 
Lines/p02/p02-150/p02-150-05.png, 1874, 87, Gay's distress and in a way that Doc , as a man , could not 
Lines/p02/p02-150/p02-150-06.png, 1784, 94, understand , knowing that Gay was as much ashamed 
Lines/p02/p02-150/p02-150-07.png, 1735, 114, for Gavin at the way he was behaving as she 
Lines/p02/p02-150/p02-150-08.png, 801, 87, was hurt for herself . 
Lines/p02/p02-144/p02-144-00.png, 1916, 161, No other news except that Elaine is engaged 
Lines/p02/p02-144/p02-144-01.png, 1642, 186, and going to marry a foreigner ... " 
Lines/p02/p02-144/p02-144-02.png, 1910, 184, Gay read the rest of the letter then put 
Lines/p02/p02-144/p02-144-03.png, 2031, 182, it back in her bag . Elaine was engaged , 
Lines/p02/p02-144/p02-144-04.png, 2036, 172, to the man she had spent so much time 
Lines/p02/p02-144/p02-144-05.png, 1895, 199, with at her party . That was why 
Lines/p02/p02-144/p02-144-06.png, 1694, 126, Gavin had come back to her . 
Lines/p02/p02-144/p02-144-07.png, 1969, 186, Everything was quite clear now , and to 
Lines/p02/p02-144/p02-144-08.png, 2078, 166, her own surprise Gay felt no heartbreak , 
Lines/p02/p02-144/p02-144-09.png, 1897, 155, rather a sense of relief now that she 
Lines/p02/p02-144/p02-144-10.png, 1880, 156, knew why Gavin had come to see 
Lines/p02/p02-144/p02-144-11.png, 193, 90, her . 
Lines/p02/p02-127/p02-127-00.png, 1700, 111, Gay nodded . " I know that you 're right Doc , I think 
Lines/p02/p02-127/p02-127-01.png, 1778, 111, now that I do realise that , and in any case , " she added 
Lines/p02/p02-127/p02-127-02.png, 1825, 114, a little sadly , " if I did change Gavin , he wouldn't 
Lines/p02/p02-127/p02-127-03.png, 1753, 107, be the same , if you know what I mean . " " You sound 
Lines/p02/p02-127/p02-127-04.png, 1836, 109, like Alice in Wonderland , " Doc gently mocked her , " and 
Lines/p02/p02-127/p02-127-05.png, 1777, 133, I 'm glad you 're beginning to see that you 're wasting 
Lines/p02/p02-127/p02-127-06.png, 839, 117, your time on that chap . 
Lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-00.png, 1711, 91, Gay thanked him and walked out on to 
Lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-01.png, 1715, 96, the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin 
Lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-02.png, 1788, 79, had bought a drink and taken it outside . 
Lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-03.png, 1701, 106, She looked round scanning the tables , 
Lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-04.png, 1534, 78, then caught her breath , a cold hand 
Lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-05.png, 1741, 88, seeming to clutch her heart . Gavin was 
Lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-06.png, 1740, 96, seated at a small table in a shadowy 
Lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-07.png, 1793, 100, corner talking animatedly to Simone . 
Lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-08.png, 1670, 99, As Gay watched he offered the girl a 
Lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-09.png, 1782, 102, cigarette and lit it , his hands cupping 
Lines/p02/p02-076/p02-076-10.png, 1158, 117, hers in an intimate way . 
Lines/p02/p02-069/p02-069-00.png, 1688, 106, Gay , a little puzzled , went through 
Lines/p02/p02-069/p02-069-01.png, 1655, 104, to the bar . Doc and Lilyan were 
Lines/p02/p02-069/p02-069-02.png, 1528, 106, sitting just inside having coffee . 
Lines/p02/p02-069/p02-069-03.png, 1579, 116, " Come and join us and bring your 
Lines/p02/p02-069/p02-069-04.png, 1655, 103, boy friend , " Doc called . " No , Doc ! " 
Lines/p02/p02-069/p02-069-05.png, 1751, 105, Lilyan remonstrated . " They want to be 
Lines/p02/p02-069/p02-069-06.png, 1663, 75, alone . " " I 've booked a table at the 
Lines/p02/p02-069/p02-069-07.png, 1746, 105, cafe*?2 , " Doc said , " they are packed 
Lines/p02/p02-069/p02-069-08.png, 1707, 124, tonight so come and join us if you 
Lines/p02/p02-069/p02-069-09.png, 1436, 87, can't find a table for two . " 
Lines/p02/p02-155/p02-155-00.png, 1633, 184, " I made it myself , " Gay tried to speak 
Lines/p02/p02-155/p02-155-01.png, 361, 150, normally . 
Lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-00.png, 1578, 91, Now let him go and you won't have to wait 
Lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-01.png, 1467, 118, long for the right man for you to come 
Lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-02.png, 1835, 104, along . If I was thirty years younger and weren't 
Lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-03.png, 1629, 87, married to the sweetest wife in the world 
Lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-04.png, 1791, 119, I 'd marry you myself . " Gay laughed , Doc was 
Lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-05.png, 1831, 96, so kind and nice and she hoped that one 
Lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-06.png, 1764, 114, day she would be able to see the situation 
Lines/p02/p02-131/p02-131-07.png, 1696, 112, as it obviously appeared to everyone else . 
Lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-00.png, 1677, 138, As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin 
Lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-01.png, 1787, 138, and Simone go through the doorway that led 
Lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-02.png, 1796, 130, down to the beach . Gay closed her eyes for a 
Lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-03.png, 1850, 119, moment in disgust . She was fully aware that Gavin 
Lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-04.png, 1792, 112, would make love to the French girl on the sands , 
Lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-05.png, 1770, 99, and no doubt he would come back soon and 
Lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-06.png, 1891, 148, after Simone had left expect her to accept his 
Lines/p02/p02-105/p02-105-07.png, 1692, 141, kisses on the way back to the hotel . 
Lines/p02/p02-135/p02-135-00.png, 1686, 115, Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once 
Lines/p02/p02-135/p02-135-01.png, 1751, 121, again Gay found herself alone at the table 
Lines/p02/p02-135/p02-135-02.png, 1777, 114, feeling self-conscious and awkward , sure that 
Lines/p02/p02-135/p02-135-03.png, 1767, 132, people were talking about the way Gavin 
Lines/p02/p02-135/p02-135-04.png, 1765, 124, was behaving since they had seen them 
Lines/p02/p02-135/p02-135-05.png, 1703, 146, dining together . She opened her bag 
Lines/p02/p02-135/p02-135-06.png, 1821, 126, to get out her compact and saw Grace's 
Lines/p02/p02-135/p02-135-07.png, 1893, 110, letter . She drew it out and opened it , 
Lines/p02/p02-135/p02-135-08.png, 1750, 159, glad to be able to occupy herself . 
Lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-00.png, 1608, 151, Gay went out to the waiting 
Lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-01.png, 1741, 119, taxi , and then found that in 
Lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-02.png, 1606, 111, the excitement of meeting 
Lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-03.png, 1850, 156, Gavin she had left her sun- 
Lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-04.png, 1760, 130, glasses on the veranda . She 
Lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-05.png, 1829, 140, went quickly back to fetch them . 
Lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-06.png, 1850, 167, Gavin and the girl who had got 
Lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-07.png, 1889, 140, off the plane with him were talking . 
Lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-08.png, 1853, 134, He was writing something in his 
Lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-09.png, 1864, 131, pocket-book , with a sick feeling 
Lines/p02/p02-008/p02-008-10.png, 1960, 152, of despair Gay knew that of course 
Lines/p02/p02-139/p02-139-00.png, 1836, 146, " So glad that you are having such a lovely time , dearie , " 
Lines/p02/p02-139/p02-139-01.png, 1819, 141, it ran . " Your cards are lovely . I rang up Miss Harland 
Lines/p02/p02-139/p02-139-02.png, 1668, 84, and have been over to sit with her father and do what 
Lines/p02/p02-139/p02-139-03.png, 1843, 148, I can for him so that she can get out to do her shopping . 
Lines/p02/p02-139/p02-139-04.png, 1735, 131, He 's getting on well but is pretty helpless still with his 
Lines/p02/p02-139/p02-139-05.png, 330, 77, broken arm . 
Lines/b06/b06-064/b06-064-00.png, 1710, 95, Powerful units have stood firm . 
Lines/b06/b06-064/b06-064-01.png, 1806, 83, In unions where the central issues 
Lines/b06/b06-064/b06-064-02.png, 1778, 87, were confused , clear policy details - 
Lines/b06/b06-064/b06-064-03.png, 1905, 93, as on bases - were decisively carried . 
Lines/b06/b06-064/b06-064-04.png, 1759, 81, This , and the numbers of active 
Lines/b06/b06-064/b06-064-05.png, 1875, 117, workers who are beginning to understand 
Lines/b06/b06-064/b06-064-06.png, 1883, 92, how and why the trick was done , 
Lines/b06/b06-064/b06-064-07.png, 1787, 101, provides a strong , immediate basis 
Lines/b06/b06-064/b06-064-08.png, 1727, 100, for a campaign against weak and 
Lines/b06/b06-064/b06-064-09.png, 1963, 97, doubtful positions , and for a consistent 
Lines/b06/b06-064/b06-064-10.png, 757, 104, peace policy . 
Lines/b06/b06-053/b06-053-00.png, 1707, 102, For we have always felt , even 
Lines/b06/b06-053/b06-053-01.png, 1739, 101, if we have then by our practice 
Lines/b06/b06-053/b06-053-02.png, 1575, 115, ignored it , the inconsistency 
Lines/b06/b06-053/b06-053-03.png, 1580, 94, between support for the war 
Lines/b06/b06-053/b06-053-04.png, 1738, 115, alliance , with resulting colossal 
Lines/b06/b06-053/b06-053-05.png, 1821, 105, spending on armaments , and our 
Lines/b06/b06-053/b06-053-06.png, 1743, 109, basic effort to improve living 
Lines/b06/b06-053/b06-053-07.png, 1647, 102, standards . Instead , we saw the 
Lines/b06/b06-053/b06-053-08.png, 1714, 104, Gaitskellites using the position 
Lines/b06/b06-053/b06-053-09.png, 1596, 108, of organisational dominance 
Lines/b06/b06-053/b06-053-10.png, 1730, 110, established during their years 
Lines/b06/b06-049/b06-049-00.png, 1867, 136, When Scarborough carried our point of view 
Lines/b06/b06-049/b06-049-01.png, 1877, 122, we were naturally delighted , more so because 
Lines/b06/b06-049/b06-049-02.png, 1810, 127, the alternatives had been put clearly to the 
Lines/b06/b06-049/b06-049-03.png, 1824, 122, movement , which had then chosen a vigorous 
Lines/b06/b06-049/b06-049-04.png, 1945, 136, anti-Nato , anti-Tory , anti-bomb and anti-German 
Lines/b06/b06-049/b06-049-05.png, 1891, 110, rearmament policy . Hopes rose as we saw a 
Lines/b06/b06-049/b06-049-06.png, 2029, 122, perspective of sharp struggle based on consistent 
Lines/b06/b06-049/b06-049-07.png, 2006, 116, lines of difference with the Tories . Many members 
Lines/b06/b06-049/b06-049-08.png, 1939, 117, understood that the bread-and-butter struggles 
Lines/b06/b06-049/b06-049-09.png, 2022, 101, of the union would become easier in the context 
Lines/b06/b06-059/b06-059-00.png, 1818, 134, It would become easy to become cynical and 
Lines/b06/b06-059/b06-059-01.png, 1895, 152, to despair . And yet , wherever the issues were put 
Lines/b06/b06-059/b06-059-02.png, 1746, 133, clearly , sections of the movement reaffirmed their 
Lines/b06/b06-059/b06-059-03.png, 1753, 144, original stand . Only where the issues were 
Lines/b06/b06-059/b06-059-04.png, 1761, 122, posed so as to cause doubt and confusion 
Lines/b06/b06-059/b06-059-05.png, 1782, 163, were positions lost . It is my view that this 
Lines/b06/b06-059/b06-059-06.png, 1739, 120, immediate confusion hides the fact that the 
Lines/b06/b06-059/b06-059-07.png, 1735, 168, Peace movement is still advancing and that 
Lines/b06/b06-059/b06-059-08.png, 1669, 138, clarification of the issues can bring a 
Lines/b06/b06-059/b06-059-09.png, 1648, 119, majority to # secure the Scarborough 
Lines/b06/b06-059/b06-059-10.png, 281, 95, decisions . 
Lines/b06/b06-087/b06-087-00.png, 1718, 121, There is only one way to develop unity and 
Lines/b06/b06-087/b06-087-01.png, 1607, 144, at the same time defend Britain . This 
Lines/b06/b06-087/b06-087-02.png, 1662, 78, was shown at the Scottish Trades Union 
Lines/b06/b06-087/b06-087-03.png, 1561, 114, Congress , representing 800,000 organised 
Lines/b06/b06-087/b06-087-04.png, 1765, 130, trade unionists , when it decided by overwhelming 
Lines/b06/b06-087/b06-087-05.png, 1772, 123, votes , to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions 
Lines/b06/b06-087/b06-087-06.png, 1633, 103, on unilateral disarmament , and to oppose 
Lines/b06/b06-087/b06-087-07.png, 1777, 107, Polaris and military bases being installed on 
Lines/b06/b06-087/b06-087-08.png, 1694, 142, the Holy Loch , or any other part of Britain .

Lines/a06/a06-064/a06-064-06.png, 1694, 112, of such ferocity . But there was ample

Lines/a06/a06-057/a06-057-00.png, 1783, 69, This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more . " I cannot be told

Lines/a06/a06-057/a06-057-03.png, 1755, 70, accused the Prime Minister of " political double talk . " " It had 
Lines/a06/a06-057/a06-057-04.png, 1828, 72, the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks this Prime

Lines/a06/a06-008/a06-008-00.png, 1817, 115, Mr. Harold Wilson , Shadow Chancellor , jumped up to

Lines/a06/a06-100/a06-100-03.png, 1683, 86, Premier said . He dismissed the idea that Britain would be 
Lines/a06/a06-100/a06-100-04.png, 1812, 132, swamped by cheap labour . Our industry , he said , would

Lines/b02/b02-097/b02-097-06.png, 1748, 93, been an election campaign which more people 
Lines/b02/b02-097/b02-097-07.png, 1883, 104, in and out of the country wanted to see over 
Lines/b02/b02-097/b02-097-08.png, 591, 67, and done with . 
Lines/b02/b02-105/b02-105-00.png, 1674, 80, But they were so convinced and they 
Lines/b02/b02-105/b02-105-01.png, 1757, 89, have had to take the consequences . Mean- 
Lines/b02/b02-105/b02-105-02.png, 1701, 123, while in Germany itself the course of 
Lines/b02/b02-105/b02-105-03.png, 1681, 113, the campaign has dismayed a good 
Lines/b02/b02-105/b02-105-04.png, 1666, 100, many people : they too will be glad 
Lines/b02/b02-105/b02-105-05.png, 1411, 125, when the polling stations close . 
Lines/n02/n02-146/n02-146-00.png, 1751, 88, She was tempted to laugh , but it was as though that barb still stuck 
Lines/n02/n02-146/n02-146-01.png, 1794, 113, in her quivering flesh . " You 've an answer - of sorts - for everything , " she 
Lines/n02/n02-146/n02-146-02.png, 1670, 103, said shortly . " Personally I 've no more to say , so I suggest we get 
Lines/n02/n02-146/n02-146-03.png, 1723, 114, along . " To her great relief they arrived at the cluster of little houses 
Lines/n02/n02-146/n02-146-04.png, 1655, 105, where Hubert had been living to find the old man stowing in 
Lines/n02/n02-146/n02-146-05.png, 1549, 125, leisurely fashion his few possessions into a ramshackle and 
Lines/n02/n02-146/n02-146-06.png, 1758, 110, incredibly ancient car , surrounded by innumerable friends and relatives . 
Lines/n02/n02-049/n02-049-00.png, 1776, 186, " It 's your superior attitude that riles me . " Beryl was 
Lines/n02/n02-049/n02-049-01.png, 1669, 185, scarlet with annoyance . " How I happened to be marooned 
Lines/n02/n02-049/n02-049-02.png, 1712, 198, at Balicou doesn't interest you in the faintest degree . You 
Lines/n02/n02-049/n02-049-03.png, 1670, 241, look as though it was only what you expected of me , 
Lines/n02/n02-049/n02-049-04.png, 1692, 241, as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert 
Lines/n02/n02-049/n02-049-05.png, 684, 191, and his pals down . " 
Lines/n02/n02-098/n02-098-00.png, 1512, 87, She wavered , and at last said 
Lines/n02/n02-098/n02-098-01.png, 1650, 126, slowly , " If you must drag the truth 
Lines/n02/n02-098/n02-098-02.png, 1608, 130, out of me , I must ask you to regard 
Lines/n02/n02-098/n02-098-03.png, 1580, 116, it as confidential . " " My dear Beryl , 
Lines/n02/n02-098/n02-098-04.png, 1622, 118, don't tell me anything , if you 'd rather 
Lines/n02/n02-098/n02-098-05.png, 1560, 110, not . " He was clearly startled by her 
Lines/n02/n02-098/n02-098-06.png, 1569, 123, words . " But remember , it was you , 
Lines/n02/n02-098/n02-098-07.png, 1726, 103, not I , who started this conversation . " 
Lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-00.png, 1857, 109, DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the 
Lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-01.png, 1730, 141, time they docked at Belleray . And though Guy , 
Lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-02.png, 1852, 94, made nervous by Beryl's silence , drove at reckless 
Lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-03.png, 1804, 105, speed to the Villa , it was quickly evident that 
Lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-04.png, 1753, 121, the party was over . Piers came strolling out to 
Lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-05.png, 1840, 112, meet the Deanes , and as soon as Guy had 
Lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-06.png, 1816, 95, driven away , invited them casually to come to 
Lines/n02/n02-000/n02-000-07.png, 863, 95, his flat for a drink . 
Lines/n02/n02-154/n02-154-00.png, 1764, 97, And then she received a jolt . Old Hubert , standing 
Lines/n02/n02-154/n02-154-01.png, 1495, 85, beside her , his battered hat in his hand , his 
Lines/n02/n02-154/n02-154-02.png, 1679, 114, toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin , told her 
Lines/n02/n02-154/n02-154-03.png, 1501, 115, in halting 6patois that " 3Mistah Piers " had 
Lines/n02/n02-154/n02-154-04.png, 1597, 86, explained right at the start that " 3Mis' Beryl " 
Lines/n02/n02-154/n02-154-05.png, 1612, 86, would be 3" plenty , plenty sad " not to be back 
Lines/n02/n02-154/n02-154-06.png, 666, 58, at the Villa in time . 
Lines/n02/n02-114/n02-114-00.png, 1779, 170, Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was 
Lines/n02/n02-114/n02-114-01.png, 1819, 131, precisely the remark she had made to Guy . 
Lines/n02/n02-114/n02-114-02.png, 1795, 128, She said icily , " As you pride yourself on 
Lines/n02/n02-114/n02-114-03.png, 1675, 146, your knowledge of all the affairs of the 
Lines/n02/n02-114/n02-114-04.png, 1546, 147, island I needn't tell you that Sir John 
Lines/n02/n02-114/n02-114-05.png, 1580, 169, Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most 
Lines/n02/n02-114/n02-114-06.png, 1764, 145, important customers . " " So what ? You 're not 
Lines/n02/n02-114/n02-114-07.png, 1771, 174, trying to say that Hewson would victimise 
Lines/n02/n02-114/n02-114-08.png, 1814, 151, Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral 
Lines/n02/n02-114/n02-114-09.png, 388, 124, courage ! 
Lines/n02/n02-045/n02-045-00.png, 1743, 130, " And I 'm heartily sick of being constantly called 
Lines/n02/n02-045/n02-045-01.png, 1615, 119, to account for my manners , " he retorted . 
Lines/n02/n02-045/n02-045-02.png, 1741, 118, " What have I done wrong now ? I cover up for 
Lines/n02/n02-045/n02-045-03.png, 1740, 119, you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack 
Lines/n02/n02-045/n02-045-04.png, 1692, 113, to make the presentation , I run the damned 
Lines/n02/n02-045/n02-045-05.png, 1723, 123, party to the best of my ability - saying the 
Lines/n02/n02-045/n02-045-06.png, 1704, 132, sugary things you ought to have been there 
Lines/n02/n02-045/n02-045-07.png, 1678, 115, to say - and all you can do is to find 
Lines/n02/n02-045/n02-045-08.png, 294, 98, fault . " 
Lines/n02/n02-040/n02-040-00.png, 1767, 117, With an air of resignation he sent Judy , his 
Lines/n02/n02-040/n02-040-01.png, 1727, 110, Boxer , to the back , and made room for her 
Lines/n02/n02-040/n02-040-02.png, 1808, 121, beside him . " Is that all you want to do ? " 
Lines/n02/n02-040/n02-040-03.png, 1810, 125, he asked , letting in the clutch . " No ; I want 
Lines/n02/n02-040/n02-040-04.png, 1754, 120, to make you understand just what happened 
Lines/n02/n02-040/n02-040-05.png, 1599, 104, about this Balicou trip , " she returned 
Lines/n02/n02-040/n02-040-06.png, 1752, 118, coldly . " I 'm a little tired of being treated 
Lines/n02/n02-040/n02-040-07.png, 1268, 97, like an ineffective imbecile . " 
Lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-00.png, 1429, 110, It was all over and done with . 
Lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-01.png, 1828, 161, For the time being Beryl was content to let 
Lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-02.png, 1831, 136, it go at that , but she resolved to have 
Lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-03.png, 1660, 95, it out with Piers when a reasonable 
Lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-04.png, 1774, 121, opportunity presented itself . He must 
Lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-05.png, 1736, 92, learn that he could not treat her 
Lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-06.png, 1766, 125, with injustice and contempt , ignoring 
Lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-07.png, 1701, 131, her explanations as though he were 
Lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-08.png, 1735, 85, a schoolmaster and she a small , 
Lines/n02/n02-033/n02-033-09.png, 683, 117, ignorant child . 
Lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-00.png, 1575, 79, To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a 
Lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-01.png, 1634, 85, vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent 
Lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-02.png, 1575, 86, reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling . 
Lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-03.png, 1747, 99, But it did not take her long to realise that his mood 
Lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-04.png, 1633, 75, was less pleasant than appeared on the surface . 
Lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-05.png, 1739, 90, He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his 
Lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-06.png, 1525, 87, own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of 
Lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-07.png, 1792, 92, asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family - 
Lines/n02/n02-004/n02-004-08.png, 1715, 82, to come over and make the presentation in her stead . 
Lines/n02/n02-054/n02-054-00.png, 1867, 165, " As your employee it 's not my business 
Lines/n02/n02-054/n02-054-01.png, 1804, 137, to understand all the whys and 
Lines/n02/n02-054/n02-054-02.png, 1893, 151, wherefores of your actions , " he said 
Lines/n02/n02-054/n02-054-03.png, 1856, 164, stiffly . " Still less to criticise you . " 
Lines/n02/n02-054/n02-054-04.png, 1797, 160, " Oh , drop that nonsense , Piers ! 
Lines/n02/n02-054/n02-054-05.png, 1729, 153, Be yourself , " she exclaimed , with 
Lines/n02/n02-054/n02-054-06.png, 1901, 152, mounting exasperation . " Very well ! " He 
Lines/n02/n02-054/n02-054-07.png, 2001, 187, brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough 
Lines/n02/n02-054/n02-054-08.png, 1912, 173, path fringed and shaded by citrus trees . 
Lines/n02/n02-054/n02-054-09.png, 2019, 180, " If you want my true opinion I 'll give it . 
Lines/n02/n02-109/n02-109-00.png, 1708, 173, You see , it was , apparently , through a mistake 
Lines/n02/n02-109/n02-109-01.png, 1711, 148, on Guy's part that we missed seeing the 
Lines/n02/n02-109/n02-109-02.png, 1879, 163, flamingoes our first morning on the island . " 
Lines/n02/n02-109/n02-109-03.png, 1862, 129, " What harm could possibly have come to Forrest 
Lines/n02/n02-109/n02-109-04.png, 1656, 164, through Sir John's nonsense ? " Piers could 
Lines/n02/n02-109/n02-109-05.png, 1687, 130, hardly have spoken with more contempt . 
Lines/n02/n02-109/n02-109-06.png, 1625, 145, A bully like that respects anyone who 
Lines/n02/n02-109/n02-109-07.png, 1098, 150, dares to stand up to him . " 
Lines/n02/n02-127/n02-127-00.png, 1830, 151, " You think you could have carried more weight 
Lines/n02/n02-127/n02-127-01.png, 1580, 163, with Sir John ? " she enquired cuttingly . 
Lines/n02/n02-127/n02-127-02.png, 1890, 154, " For all your good opinion of yourself , 
Lines/n02/n02-127/n02-127-03.png, 1831, 146, I doubt it . He 's about as easy to push around 
Lines/n02/n02-127/n02-127-04.png, 1730, 159, as - as a grounded whale ! " He had to smile 
Lines/n02/n02-127/n02-127-05.png, 1766, 120, at that , but went on airily , " I 'd have made 
Lines/n02/n02-127/n02-127-06.png, 1730, 126, an attempt to show my lady-love that I 
Lines/n02/n02-127/n02-127-07.png, 1294, 146, put her interests before my own . 
Lines/n02/n02-016/n02-016-00.png, 1779, 106, " Oh , she was due ! " And then he added in the same 
Lines/n02/n02-016/n02-016-01.png, 1796, 139, casual tone , " She 's not returning to her family . She 's 
Lines/n02/n02-016/n02-016-02.png, 1790, 116, going to live with friends of the bank manager , just 
Lines/n02/n02-016/n02-016-03.png, 1856, 98, this side of Belleray . " Mrs. Deane made a suitable 
Lines/n02/n02-016/n02-016-04.png, 1868, 113, comment , but Beryl said nothing . She was trying 
Lines/n02/n02-016/n02-016-05.png, 1692, 114, to sort things out in her mind . That beneath his 
Lines/n02/n02-016/n02-016-06.png, 1806, 141, unnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering 
Lines/n02/n02-016/n02-016-07.png, 1420, 123, with anger against her she had no doubt . 
Lines/n02/n02-009/n02-009-00.png, 1632, 113, " I caught him just as he was going to the 
Lines/n02/n02-009/n02-009-01.png, 1687, 85, airport to meet Blanche , " he said . " As a matter 
Lines/n02/n02-009/n02-009-02.png, 1546, 97, of fact I 'd asked him last night to deputise 
Lines/n02/n02-009/n02-009-03.png, 1696, 93, for me and fetch her . He brought her to the party 
Lines/n02/n02-009/n02-009-04.png, 1678, 74, too . They 're both here . " " I didn't know she was 
Lines/n02/n02-009/n02-009-05.png, 1531, 96, coming back from Barbados so soon . " Beryl 
Lines/n02/n02-009/n02-009-06.png, 1458, 86, said the first thing that came into her head . 
Lines/n02/n02-104/n02-104-00.png, 1679, 161, " I know . Absurd as it may seem , I didn't want 
Lines/n02/n02-104/n02-104-01.png, 1706, 107, you to think badly of me . " She turned away 
Lines/n02/n02-104/n02-104-02.png, 1775, 157, from him to fondle Judy , who , sensing something 
Lines/n02/n02-104/n02-104-03.png, 1740, 142, amiss , was nudging her in the endeavour to 
Lines/n02/n02-104/n02-104-04.png, 1725, 115, gain her attention . " The truth is that 
Lines/n02/n02-104/n02-104-05.png, 1724, 133, if I had absolutely insisted on sailing at the 
Lines/n02/n02-104/n02-104-06.png, 1746, 158, time originally arranged , Sir John would 
Lines/n02/n02-104/n02-104-07.png, 990, 119, have had it in for Guy . 
Lines/n02/n02-062/n02-062-00.png, 1809, 128, You made some sort of a protest to Graybury . 
Lines/n02/n02-062/n02-062-01.png, 1947, 114, I 'll give you credit for that . But you didn't press 
Lines/n02/n02-062/n02-062-02.png, 1811, 135, the matter because , very naturally , you were 
Lines/n02/n02-062/n02-062-03.png, 1705, 131, thoroughly enjoying Forrest's company in 
Lines/n02/n02-062/n02-062-04.png, 1730, 137, idyllic surroundings . " " How dare you say 
Lines/n02/n02-062/n02-062-05.png, 1761, 140, such a thing ? " she blazed . " For goodness' 
Lines/n02/n02-062/n02-062-06.png, 1799, 138, sake show a glimmer of reason , " was his 
Lines/n02/n02-062/n02-062-07.png, 1147, 138, equally indignant rejoinder . 
Lines/n02/n02-028/n02-028-00.png, 1573, 211, Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise , and to 
Lines/n02/n02-028/n02-028-01.png, 1739, 304, express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment 
Lines/n02/n02-028/n02-028-02.png, 1718, 228, of his guests . But Piers remained aloof , and when Beryl 
Lines/n02/n02-028/n02-028-03.png, 1718, 232, suggested having a second party , the following week , he 
Lines/n02/n02-028/n02-028-04.png, 1696, 226, poured cold water on the project . Everyone , he declared , 
Lines/n02/n02-028/n02-028-05.png, 1709, 248, had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them 
Lines/n02/n02-028/n02-028-06.png, 1671, 249, nearly to next week to settle down again . Meanwhile 
Lines/n02/n02-028/n02-028-07.png, 1643, 163, Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-

Lines/d06/d06-086/d06-086-00.png, 1731, 143, The housewife would find life far less tiring 
Lines/d06/d06-086/d06-086-01.png, 1844, 150, if she made a list , followed a routine of work 
Lines/d06/d06-086/d06-086-02.png, 1874, 153, rather than getting from one thing to the next . 
Lines/d06/d06-086/d06-086-03.png, 1844, 140, The business man would find that he reached 
Lines/d06/d06-086/d06-086-04.png, 1775, 152, the end of the day with far less strain if 
Lines/d06/d06-086/d06-086-05.png, 1731, 135, he was a little more systematic . To drift 
Lines/d06/d06-086/d06-086-06.png, 1874, 155, aimlessly along is more wearying than any- 
Lines/d06/d06-086/d06-086-07.png, 1904, 150, thing else . If we would only sit down and 
Lines/d06/d06-086/d06-086-08.png, 1867, 160, write out all the necessary jobs waiting to 
Lines/d06/d06-086/d06-086-09.png, 1887, 149, be done and then work quietly through them , 
Lines/d06/d06-086/d06-086-10.png, 1975, 179, we would find life considerably less exhausting 
Lines/d06/d06-104/d06-104-00.png, 1740, 179, They only worked , of course , a five- 
Lines/d06/d06-104/d06-104-01.png, 1752, 185, day week so that in the first week 
Lines/d06/d06-104/d06-104-02.png, 1767, 190, Monday to Friday were days one 
Lines/d06/d06-104/d06-104-03.png, 1867, 205, to five of the timetable , the following 
Lines/d06/d06-104/d06-104-04.png, 1795, 205, Monday was day six and Tuesday 
Lines/d06/d06-104/d06-104-05.png, 1839, 199, started day one again and so on . 
Lines/d06/d06-104/d06-104-06.png, 1800, 184, By this means they avoided each 
Lines/d06/d06-104/d06-104-07.png, 1841, 195, week being the same with a pupil 
Lines/d06/d06-104/d06-104-08.png, 1843, 205, knowing exactly what the subject 
Lines/d06/d06-104/d06-104-09.png, 1757, 189, would be on Friday afternoon at 
Lines/d06/d06-104/d06-104-10.png, 311, 128, 3 p.m. . 
Lines/d06/d06-107/d06-107-00.png, 1843, 143, It was a little complicated to work , 
Lines/d06/d06-107/d06-107-01.png, 1634, 175, of course , and there had to be a big 
Lines/d06/d06-107/d06-107-02.png, 1851, 178, notice in the entrance saying which 
Lines/d06/d06-107/d06-107-03.png, 1949, 183, day of the timetable it was - but 
Lines/d06/d06-107/d06-107-04.png, 1923, 165, it added immensely to the interest 
Lines/d06/d06-107/d06-107-05.png, 1764, 162, and kept everybody on their toes . 
Lines/d06/d06-107/d06-107-06.png, 1769, 172, To have order does not mean getting 
Lines/d06/d06-107/d06-107-07.png, 1670, 188, into a dull routine . I have great 
Lines/d06/d06-107/d06-107-08.png, 1716, 206, sympathy with the young wife 
Lines/d06/d06-107/d06-107-09.png, 1643, 169, who does not always want to do 
Lines/d06/d06-107/d06-107-10.png, 1344, 188, the washing on a Monday . 
Lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-00.png, 1728, 135, To others , the long hours of the night bring 
Lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-01.png, 1602, 135, only a disturbed tossing and turning 
Lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-02.png, 1825, 169, which causes them to wake feeling worse 
Lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-03.png, 1911, 158, than when they went to bed . We may begin 
Lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-04.png, 1898, 99, to understand this a little better when we 
Lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-05.png, 1847, 145, realize that tiredness itself is largely in 
Lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-06.png, 1762, 145, the mind . Very few people , under normal 
Lines/d06/d06-037/d06-037-07.png, 1883, 110, conditions , work themselves to a standstill . 
Lines/d06/d06-067/d06-067-00.png, 1890, 186, In other ways , too , life for the ordinary 
Lines/d06/d06-067/d06-067-01.png, 1770, 136, individual has become so complex 
Lines/d06/d06-067/d06-067-02.png, 1999, 117, that it taxes the mind . Two hundred 
Lines/d06/d06-067/d06-067-03.png, 1847, 169, years ago , men lived and worked 
Lines/d06/d06-067/d06-067-04.png, 1771, 203, in one place , their lives were of one 
Lines/d06/d06-067/d06-067-05.png, 1879, 175, piece . Now a man may live twenty , 
Lines/d06/d06-067/d06-067-06.png, 1727, 196, thirty even sixty miles from his 
Lines/d06/d06-067/d06-067-07.png, 1596, 166, work . The only connexion is the 
Lines/d06/d06-067/d06-067-08.png, 1824, 174, pipeline of the railway on which they 
Lines/d06/d06-067/d06-067-09.png, 927, 179, travel day by day . 
Lines/d06/d06-027/d06-027-00.png, 2023, 140, Toyohiko Kagawa . Loving Saviour , who experienced 
Lines/d06/d06-027/d06-027-01.png, 1780, 86, all human emotion , and whose sensitive 
Lines/d06/d06-027/d06-027-02.png, 1896, 102, nature knows better than we do , what it is to 
Lines/d06/d06-027/d06-027-03.png, 1915, 130, be really afraid , help us to know that when 
Lines/d06/d06-027/d06-027-04.png, 1911, 156, we face life boldly , many of the shadows are 
Lines/d06/d06-027/d06-027-05.png, 1931, 103, seen to be allies and not enemies and that , 
Lines/d06/d06-027/d06-027-06.png, 1860, 133, come what may , we are never alone when 
Lines/d06/d06-027/d06-027-07.png, 776, 91, we are with Thee . 
Lines/d06/d06-072/d06-072-00.png, 1722, 121, In many cases , their homes know little of 
Lines/d06/d06-072/d06-072-01.png, 1796, 131, their place of work and their associates at 
Lines/d06/d06-072/d06-072-02.png, 1821, 158, the office or works wonder what they 
Lines/d06/d06-072/d06-072-03.png, 1774, 147, are possibly like in the surroundings of their 
Lines/d06/d06-072/d06-072-04.png, 1894, 144, homes . It is easy , desperately easy , to lead 
Lines/d06/d06-072/d06-072-05.png, 1697, 149, a ' double ' life without ever deliberately 
Lines/d06/d06-072/d06-072-06.png, 1842, 150, planning to do so or in fact being conscious 
Lines/d06/d06-072/d06-072-07.png, 1878, 158, of what is going on . It is easier to live life in 
Lines/d06/d06-072/d06-072-08.png, 1785, 124, compartments but over the years it builds up , 
Lines/d06/d06-072/d06-072-09.png, 1931, 175, and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which 
Lines/d06/d06-072/d06-072-10.png, 1361, 86, need to be handled correctly . 
Lines/d06/d06-011/d06-011-00.png, 1775, 149, Because situations which may contain 
Lines/d06/d06-011/d06-011-01.png, 1914, 148, all the elements of fear can arise suddenly , 
Lines/d06/d06-011/d06-011-02.png, 1848, 190, it is a good idea to condition a child 
Lines/d06/d06-011/d06-011-03.png, 1892, 175, to some extent against it . To keep a child 
Lines/d06/d06-011/d06-011-04.png, 1655, 124, of twelve or thirteen under the 
Lines/d06/d06-011/d06-011-05.png, 1708, 208, impression that nothing nasty ever 
Lines/d06/d06-011/d06-011-06.png, 1858, 161, happens is not merely dishonest , it 
Lines/d06/d06-011/d06-011-07.png, 1698, 167, is unwise . As I shall suggest in a 
Lines/d06/d06-011/d06-011-08.png, 1696, 156, later chapter there are some situations 
Lines/d06/d06-011/d06-011-09.png, 1645, 192, which occur less frequently than 
Lines/d06/d06-111/d06-111-00.png, 1781, 146, I would not want to either , but if she wants to get through 
Lines/d06/d06-111/d06-111-01.png, 1702, 145, the day without becoming exhausted , she will be well advised to 
Lines/d06/d06-111/d06-111-02.png, 1807, 154, sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to 
Lines/d06/d06-111/d06-111-03.png, 1751, 140, do , note the order in which they can most conveniently be 
Lines/d06/d06-111/d06-111-04.png, 1771, 117, done ( or must be done because of other predetermined factors 
Lines/d06/d06-111/d06-111-05.png, 1783, 137, - you must , for example , do your shopping on the morning of 
Lines/d06/d06-111/d06-111-06.png, 619, 150, the early closing day ) . 
Lines/d06/d06-041/d06-041-00.png, 1758, 119, The mind tires first and conveys the impression 
Lines/d06/d06-041/d06-041-01.png, 1757, 130, of tiredness to the body . This can be proved by 
Lines/d06/d06-041/d06-041-02.png, 1791, 133, noting the effect of a new stimulus on some- 
Lines/d06/d06-041/d06-041-03.png, 1805, 141, body who feels thoroughly tired . Suppose 
Lines/d06/d06-041/d06-041-04.png, 1694, 139, a mother has news late at night that her 
Lines/d06/d06-041/d06-041-05.png, 1720, 139, child is in danger . She will undertake a 
Lines/d06/d06-041/d06-041-06.png, 1792, 137, journey which , an hour before , she would 
Lines/d06/d06-041/d06-041-07.png, 1079, 122, have declared impossible . 
Lines/d06/d06-082/d06-082-00.png, 1777, 140, If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time - 
Lines/d06/d06-082/d06-082-01.png, 1601, 111, we lose this way in the course of a day we would be 
Lines/d06/d06-082/d06-082-02.png, 1830, 137, staggered . Some of it is inevitable , and we do not want to 
Lines/d06/d06-082/d06-082-03.png, 1767, 111, become too pernickety . Nevertheless , we could all probably 
Lines/d06/d06-082/d06-082-04.png, 1758, 140, be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle 
Lines/d06/d06-082/d06-082-05.png, 230, 140, through . 
Lines/d06/d06-050/d06-050-00.png, 1821, 132, Nor is she necessarily being deceitful . She really did feel tired 
Lines/d06/d06-050/d06-050-01.png, 1832, 147, until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an 
Lines/d06/d06-050/d06-050-02.png, 1781, 106, attractive - interest ! Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do 
Lines/d06/d06-050/d06-050-03.png, 1808, 126, with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion . A 
Lines/d06/d06-050/d06-050-04.png, 1786, 161, disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense 
Lines/d06/d06-050/d06-050-05.png, 1809, 158, of fatigue . They wonder why they get no rest at night , 
Lines/d06/d06-050/d06-050-06.png, 682, 132, even if they do sleep . 
Lines/d06/d06-003/d06-003-00.png, 1771, 131, Even worse is to laugh . Tremendous damage may be done to a child 
Lines/d06/d06-003/d06-003-01.png, 1701, 165, by laughing at what are very real fears . As adults , we know 
Lines/d06/d06-003/d06-003-02.png, 1823, 145, that their fears are groundless , indeed to us they appear laughable , 
Lines/d06/d06-003/d06-003-03.png, 1753, 145, but to a child they are very real . Not that I am suggesting 
Lines/d06/d06-003/d06-003-04.png, 1754, 155, that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made 
Lines/d06/d06-003/d06-003-05.png, 1794, 142, to face their fears , to see through them and come out on the 
Lines/d06/d06-003/d06-003-06.png, 619, 73, other side as victors . 
Lines/d06/d06-008/d06-008-00.png, 1855, 104, To ridicule them only pushes them farther 
Lines/d06/d06-008/d06-008-01.png, 1619, 107, into themselves , so that they become 
Lines/d06/d06-008/d06-008-02.png, 1858, 109, unable to speak about it to anybody and 
Lines/d06/d06-008/d06-008-03.png, 2001, 105, the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown , 
Lines/d06/d06-008/d06-008-04.png, 1833, 107, the harvest of which may still be being 
Lines/d06/d06-008/d06-008-05.png, 1671, 105, reaped at forty or fifty . Far better to 
Lines/d06/d06-008/d06-008-06.png, 1658, 104, agree with a child that a particular 
Lines/d06/d06-008/d06-008-07.png, 1831, 113, situation is frightening , and then to face 
Lines/d06/d06-008/d06-008-08.png, 1809, 102, it together until the child can see how 
Lines/d06/d06-008/d06-008-09.png, 1146, 102, unnecessary its fears were . 
Lines/d06/d06-000/d06-000-00.png, 1732, 91, In the first place it is not a great deal 
Lines/d06/d06-000/d06-000-01.png, 1678, 89, of use telling even children , as I have 
Lines/d06/d06-000/d06-000-02.png, 1689, 83, already suggested , not to be silly or 
Lines/d06/d06-000/d06-000-03.png, 1764, 95, to pull themselves together . Far better 
Lines/d06/d06-000/d06-000-04.png, 1821, 80, to help them to face whatever it is that 
Lines/d06/d06-000/d06-000-05.png, 1653, 92, is worrying them , to find the original 
Lines/d06/d06-000/d06-000-06.png, 1737, 67, cause and then deal with it ; show it 
Lines/d06/d06-000/d06-000-07.png, 1869, 87, up either for the sham it is - and many 
Lines/d06/d06-000/d06-000-08.png, 1599, 74, fears are based upon completely 
Lines/d06/d06-000/d06-000-09.png, 1773, 76, irrational pre-conceived notions - or to 
Lines/d06/d06-056/d06-056-00.png, 1901, 141, They drag themselves around and can become 
Lines/d06/d06-056/d06-056-01.png, 1885, 106, a burden to their families and their friends . 
Lines/d06/d06-056/d06-056-02.png, 1889, 114, Any mental confusion can cause this and 
Lines/d06/d06-056/d06-056-03.png, 1773, 170, the best way is probably to seek advice . 
Lines/d06/d06-056/d06-056-04.png, 1861, 106, As we are unable to cure our own bodies 
Lines/d06/d06-056/d06-056-05.png, 1941, 183, if the cause of our pain is too deep seated , 
Lines/d06/d06-056/d06-056-06.png, 1896, 89, so we are unable to cure our own minds , 
Lines/d06/d06-056/d06-056-07.png, 1837, 128, if the trouble is a complicated one 
Lines/d06/d06-056/d06-056-08.png, 1896, 161, involving careful and patient treatment . 
Lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-00.png, 1845, 106, Even more simply , test your own reactions 
Lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-01.png, 1900, 95, to different situations . There are some which 
Lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-02.png, 1800, 110, bring on an almost immediate feeling of 
Lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-03.png, 1870, 103, tiredness - such as when your wife mentions 
Lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-04.png, 1682, 121, the washing-up - while others , if they 
Lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-05.png, 1809, 112, refer to something you like doing , bring a 
Lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-06.png, 1857, 117, veritable surge of energy . Many a girl who 
Lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-07.png, 1845, 101, is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump 
Lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-08.png, 1857, 101, up with no apparent tiredness at all when 
Lines/d06/d06-046/d06-046-09.png, 1926, 110, her boy friend calls and go for a long walk . 
Lines/d06/d06-076/d06-076-00.png, 1811, 143, Can we then frame some ' rules ' which may enable us to live life 
Lines/d06/d06-076/d06-076-01.png, 1777, 157, as fully as possible , without having our energy sapped by un- 
Lines/d06/d06-076/d06-076-02.png, 1750, 128, necessary weariness . ( a ) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness . 
Lines/d06/d06-076/d06-076-03.png, 1735, 161, We have a saying ' My head will never save my feet ' . Time 
Lines/d06/d06-076/d06-076-04.png, 1684, 152, after time we forget something and have to go back 
Lines/d06/d06-076/d06-076-05.png, 940, 109, upstairs or down to the shops .

Lines/d06/d06-100/d06-100-01.png, 1638, 133, in a predetermined groove , I would 
Lines/d06/d06-100/d06-100-02.png, 1813, 174, hardly like to add further to the dullness 
Lines/d06/d06-100/d06-100-03.png, 1774, 144, which it engenders . But I am not arguing 
Lines/d06/d06-100/d06-100-04.png, 1906, 160, for this . I know how much of a drag it can be 
Lines/d06/d06-100/d06-100-05.png, 1818, 97, and I was interested some little while 
Lines/d06/d06-100/d06-100-06.png, 1774, 123, ago to hear of a school who tried a six-

Lines/d06/d06-063/d06-063-00.png, 1771, 96, In the days when most people were born ,

Lines/d06/d06-063/d06-063-02.png, 1863, 112, the village , it was not difficult for anybody 
Lines/d06/d06-063/d06-063-03.png, 1768, 93, to live a day at a time . Even those who 
Lines/d06/d06-063/d06-063-04.png, 1754, 113, held a high and responsible office lived in 
Lines/d06/d06-063/d06-063-05.png, 1909, 117, far greater simplicity than their successors . 
Lines/d06/d06-063/d06-063-06.png, 1886, 123, When news from the Continent took days , 
Lines/d06/d06-063/d06-063-07.png, 1776, 98, from America weeks , from the Far East , 
Lines/d06/d06-063/d06-063-08.png, 1837, 123, months , even a Prime Minister could go to

Lines/d06/d06-063/d06-063-10.png, 1900, 76, be happening at the other end of England , 
Lines/d06/d06-096/d06-096-00.png, 1775, 127, I am more than conscious of this . How anybody 
Lines/d06/d06-096/d06-096-01.png, 1778, 123, can go through the same routine day in and day 
Lines/d06/d06-096/d06-096-02.png, 1955, 140, out for forty years I find difficult to understand . 
Lines/d06/d06-096/d06-096-03.png, 1953, 126, A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and 
Lines/d06/d06-096/d06-096-04.png, 1813, 155, commerce may be kept going - though if ever 
Lines/d06/d06-096/d06-096-05.png, 1772, 135, it becomes possible to work out a system 
Lines/d06/d06-096/d06-096-06.png, 1790, 151, of ' staggered ' hours it may do an immense

Lines/d06/d06-030/d06-030-00.png, 1776, 149, Amen . MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a

Lines/d06/d06-030/d06-030-02.png, 1854, 141, partly true . Many people wake up tired of a morning and no 
Lines/d06/d06-030/d06-030-03.png, 1754, 132, amount of rest seems to make any difference . Sleep , to be 
Lines/d06/d06-030/d06-030-04.png, 1782, 128, effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes 
Lines/d06/d06-030/d06-030-05.png, 436, 126, from innocence .

Lines/d06/d06-060/d06-060-00.png, 1726, 147, One of the greatest steps forward that has been 
Lines/d06/d06-060/d06-060-01.png, 1770, 134, made this century is the way in which illness 
Lines/d06/d06-060/d06-060-02.png, 1747, 151, of the mind is no longer feared or shunned , 
Lines/d06/d06-060/d06-060-03.png, 1848, 148, and is in fact no differently regarded than 
Lines/d06/d06-060/d06-060-04.png, 1813, 162, physical illness . There is , nevertheless , a 
Lines/d06/d06-060/d06-060-05.png, 1866, 157, great deal of tiredness which comes from 
Lines/d06/d06-060/d06-060-06.png, 1845, 168, no major complication but results from an 
Lines/d06/d06-060/d06-060-07.png, 1861, 150, inability to deal with life , especially under 
Lines/d06/d06-060/d06-060-08.png, 1722, 148, the diverse pattern which is the twentieth

Lines/r02/r02-065/r02-065-00.png, 1726, 154, They closed on a single bundle and , fumbling with 
Lines/r02/r02-065/r02-065-01.png, 1573, 148, nervous excitement , he pulled it out . His eye 
Lines/r02/r02-065/r02-065-02.png, 1696, 131, rested on a wad of stiff white paper printed on one 
Lines/r02/r02-065/r02-065-03.png, 1667, 156, side . ' Old fashioned fivers ! ' he muttered again , and 
Lines/r02/r02-065/r02-065-04.png, 1785, 134, tried to recall if they were still legal tender . Surely the 
Lines/r02/r02-065/r02-065-05.png, 1803, 142, Govr. and Compa. of the Bank of England would never 
Lines/r02/r02-065/r02-065-06.png, 1803, 152, break their promise to pay on rude demand , let

Lines/r02/r02-038/r02-038-00.png, 1652, 123, ' It 's not mine . I wasn't sitting there . ' She blinked 
Lines/r02/r02-038/r02-038-01.png, 1228, 125, disdainfully at him and stepped out . 
Lines/r02/r02-038/r02-038-02.png, 1736, 143, It was a new briefcase , and as the train jogged along 
Lines/r02/r02-038/r02-038-03.png, 1547, 141, the shiny clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil . 
Lines/r02/r02-038/r02-038-04.png, 1751, 130, He wondered what it contained . Probably the remains 
Lines/r02/r02-038/r02-038-05.png, 1391, 121, of someone's lunch or a few secret files . 
Lines/r02/r02-038/r02-038-06.png, 947, 112, He smiled at his own joke . 
Lines/r02/r02-013/r02-013-00.png, 1771, 104, The train drew into another station 
Lines/r02/r02-013/r02-013-01.png, 1775, 126, and Cecil , with a further six stops 
Lines/r02/r02-013/r02-013-02.png, 1773, 151, to go , was left almost alone in the 
Lines/r02/r02-013/r02-013-03.png, 1796, 125, coach . He fumed as he recol- 
Lines/r02/r02-013/r02-013-04.png, 1708, 132, lected the long correspondence he 
Lines/r02/r02-013/r02-013-05.png, 1829, 119, had had with the Inland Reve- 
Lines/r02/r02-013/r02-013-06.png, 1772, 120, nue in an effort to obtain 
Lines/r02/r02-013/r02-013-07.png, 1659, 166, tax relief for a jacket used 
Lines/r02/r02-013/r02-013-08.png, 1786, 180, solely in the office . ' If the jacket 
Lines/r02/r02-013/r02-013-09.png, 1925, 174, is a condition of your employment , ' 
Lines/r02/r02-013/r02-013-10.png, 1806, 158, the Inspector had written , ' it may

Lines/r02/r02-127/r02-127-00.png, 1771, 99, Cecil wriggled irritably under the misplaced management 
Lines/r02/r02-127/r02-127-01.png, 1656, 87, of a mother who had failed to realise that a son 
Lines/r02/r02-127/r02-127-02.png, 1793, 90, who is nearly bald is no longer a baby . He started to 
Lines/r02/r02-127/r02-127-03.png, 1737, 91, climb the stairs , stamping with unnecessary vigour upon 
Lines/r02/r02-127/r02-127-04.png, 1666, 97, the treads . ' And don't wipe the dirt off on the 
Lines/r02/r02-127/r02-127-05.png, 993, 111, towel like you did yesterday . 
Lines/r02/r02-054/r02-054-00.png, 1777, 176, It was locked . Eager fingers felt bulky contents and 
Lines/r02/r02-054/r02-054-01.png, 1833, 203, when he shook the case there was a rustling thud 
Lines/r02/r02-054/r02-054-02.png, 1790, 130, of wads of paper . ' Cor ! ' he muttered aloud , ' there 's 
Lines/r02/r02-054/r02-054-03.png, 1762, 136, five thousand at least . ' He felt in his jacket pocket 
Lines/r02/r02-054/r02-054-04.png, 1780, 178, and pulled out a key ring . In succession he tried 
Lines/r02/r02-054/r02-054-05.png, 1701, 141, his own briefcase key , a suitcase key and a 
Lines/r02/r02-054/r02-054-06.png, 1382, 162, device designed to lock typewriters . 
Lines/r02/r02-060/r02-060-00.png, 1793, 158, Cecil searched in his pockets once 
Lines/r02/r02-060/r02-060-01.png, 1516, 146, more and came up with two 
Lines/r02/r02-060/r02-060-02.png, 1726, 158, paper-clips . After a few seconds 
Lines/r02/r02-060/r02-060-03.png, 1702, 171, of twisting , he roughly thrust a 
Lines/r02/r02-060/r02-060-04.png, 1747, 131, bent wire loop into the lock and 
Lines/r02/r02-060/r02-060-05.png, 1717, 152, waggled it around vigorously . 
Lines/r02/r02-060/r02-060-06.png, 1540, 126, There was a click and the 
Lines/r02/r02-060/r02-060-07.png, 1747, 150, briefcase opened . Cecil thrust an 
Lines/r02/r02-060/r02-060-08.png, 1710, 342, eager hand inside , his fingers 
Lines/r02/r02-060/r02-060-09.png, 1567, 194, groping after wads of five

Lines/r02/r02-131/r02-131-00.png, 1732, 107, Your Auntie Edie 's coming in for a cup of tea later and 
Lines/r02/r02-131/r02-131-01.png, 1791, 74, you know how she has a good look round everywhere . ' There was 
Lines/r02/r02-131/r02-131-02.png, 1811, 93, a tinkle and a thud from beside the coat cupboard . Cecil's 
Lines/r02/r02-131/r02-131-03.png, 1781, 80, mother turned around in time to see the briefcase collapse 
Lines/r02/r02-131/r02-131-04.png, 1882, 82, against the brass umbrella stand . ' Well now ! ' She hurried 
Lines/r02/r02-131/r02-131-05.png, 1100, 84, towards it and picked it up . 
Lines/r02/r02-003/r02-003-00.png, 1676, 113, He read the film star's sorry story and frowned at the 
Lines/r02/r02-003/r02-003-01.png, 1734, 97, provisions of Schedule D taxation which not only allowed her 
Lines/r02/r02-003/r02-003-02.png, 1688, 97, to claim relief on the most unlikely purchases , but also 
Lines/r02/r02-003/r02-003-03.png, 1777, 101, postponed demanding the tax until her financial year 
Lines/r02/r02-003/r02-003-04.png, 1705, 93, was ended , audited and agreed by the Inspector . The

Lines/l01/l01-095/l01-095-00.png, 1683, 68, When Nick returned home he found that his 
Lines/l01/l01-095/l01-095-01.png, 1675, 85, mother was seriously ill . She had pneumonia . The 
Lines/l01/l01-095/l01-095-02.png, 1755, 65, sight of her youngest son , the doctor said , was the 
Lines/l01/l01-095/l01-095-03.png, 1763, 66, only thing that saved her ; it gave her the strength 
Lines/l01/l01-095/l01-095-04.png, 1682, 81, she needed to fight for life . Soon she was out of 
Lines/l01/l01-095/l01-095-05.png, 1705, 54, danger , but the doctor told Dan that she would 
Lines/l01/l01-095/l01-095-06.png, 1719, 68, have to remain in bed for some time and 
Lines/l01/l01-095/l01-095-07.png, 1760, 63, that thereafter it was essential that she should 
Lines/l01/l01-095/l01-095-08.png, 1107, 63, not have to exert herself . 
Lines/l01/l01-111/l01-111-00.png, 1823, 104, Only the old man's room was too much for 
Lines/l01/l01-111/l01-111-01.png, 1846, 99, her . Once she put her head round the door , 
Lines/l01/l01-111/l01-111-02.png, 1707, 108, and Sam shouted : " You get right out of 
Lines/l01/l01-111/l01-111-03.png, 1772, 127, this , Rose . You leave me in peace . " 
Lines/l01/l01-111/l01-111-04.png, 1911, 118, Rose took one breath of the stagnant air . 
Lines/l01/l01-111/l01-111-05.png, 1883, 127, " You - you polecat ! " she screeched , and 
Lines/l01/l01-111/l01-111-06.png, 1804, 140, retreated without argument . Her re*? 
Lines/l01/l01-111/l01-111-07.png, 1812, 122, 2gime , hated alike by all the men , 
Lines/l01/l01-111/l01-111-08.png, 1809, 108, produced one extraordinary result . 
Lines/l01/l01-179/l01-179-00.png, 1666, 206, Sam sank back on his pillow . " Oh , my 
Lines/l01/l01-179/l01-179-01.png, 1677, 177, God ! All right , you win ! " With that settled 
Lines/l01/l01-179/l01-179-02.png, 1739, 115, Fred was soon married . The First Flower 
Lines/l01/l01-179/l01-179-03.png, 1823, 153, snatched up her infant and departed , mut- 
Lines/l01/l01-179/l01-179-04.png, 1683, 139, tering sarcasms . The whole household 
Lines/l01/l01-179/l01-179-05.png, 1785, 138, listened to the dwindling screams of the 
Lines/l01/l01-179/l01-179-06.png, 1875, 174, baby with relief . Maggie soon proved her 
Lines/l01/l01-179/l01-179-07.png, 1830, 141, worth , and after a time Dan summed up 
Lines/l01/l01-179/l01-179-08.png, 1511, 183, the general approval by saying : 
Lines/l01/l01-007/l01-007-00.png, 1834, 81, One of the small ones . Sark , that 's it . The Caxtons 
Lines/l01/l01-007/l01-007-01.png, 1862, 77, used to have their holidays there . Starmouth went 
Lines/l01/l01-007/l01-007-02.png, 1767, 84, there . He dug out some people who remembered 
Lines/l01/l01-007/l01-007-03.png, 1833, 88, the family . In the end he pieced it all together . 
Lines/l01/l01-007/l01-007-04.png, 1821, 73, The Caxtons had two boys - Michael and Derek . 
Lines/l01/l01-007/l01-007-05.png, 961, 58, Pete first met them at school . 
Lines/l01/l01-030/l01-030-00.png, 1712, 176, He sponged off him until he died 
Lines/l01/l01-030/l01-030-01.png, 1790, 155, just after the war . Then Pete had to 
Lines/l01/l01-030/l01-030-02.png, 1660, 147, look around for some other 
Lines/l01/l01-030/l01-030-03.png, 1813, 189, security . He found it - Dackson's Wharf , 
Lines/l01/l01-030/l01-030-04.png, 1894, 145, and Dackson's daughter . Mrs. Caxton's 
Lines/l01/l01-030/l01-030-05.png, 1986, 155, other boy , Derek , had been killed in the war . 
Lines/l01/l01-030/l01-030-06.png, 2001, 169, After her husband died her brain began 
Lines/l01/l01-030/l01-030-07.png, 1891, 175, to fade . At times she thought Pete was 
Lines/l01/l01-030/l01-030-08.png, 1196, 176, really her own son . 
Lines/l01/l01-119/l01-119-00.png, 1559, 112, One day Fred met Nick at the front door as they were both 
Lines/l01/l01-119/l01-119-01.png, 1469, 98, about to enter the house . Fred grasped his brother's elbow . 
Lines/l01/l01-119/l01-119-02.png, 1616, 120, " Nick , I can't stomach this much longer . " " Nor me . What 's the 
Lines/l01/l01-119/l01-119-03.png, 1661, 118, answer ? Mum 's picking up , but she 'll never be her old self 
Lines/l01/l01-119/l01-119-04.png, 166, 108, again . " 
Lines/l01/l01-119/l01-119-05.png, 1728, 113, " That First Flower 's driving me nuts , " Fred said . " I 'm going to put 
Lines/l01/l01-119/l01-119-06.png, 340, 86, a stop to it . " 
Lines/l01/l01-119/l01-119-07.png, 603, 96, " What with - arsenic ? " 
Lines/l01/l01-023/l01-023-00.png, 1829, 85, He was always a smooth liar . He invented some 
Lines/l01/l01-023/l01-023-01.png, 1774, 88, plausible story or other and threw himself on 
Lines/l01/l01-023/l01-023-02.png, 1779, 84, the Caxtons' generosity . They accepted him as a 
Lines/l01/l01-023/l01-023-03.png, 1806, 87, kind of substitute for the boy they had lost . 
Lines/l01/l01-023/l01-023-04.png, 1748, 85, Outside the family he began to pass himself 
Lines/l01/l01-023/l01-023-05.png, 1874, 90, off as Michael Caxton . The father was well-off 
Lines/l01/l01-023/l01-023-06.png, 1803, 106, and easy-going . He was easy meat for Pete . 
Lines/l01/l01-016/l01-016-00.png, 1819, 99, It was a good school I sent him to , one of the best . 
Lines/l01/l01-016/l01-016-01.png, 1794, 84, He was a boarder . He could always turn on the 
Lines/l01/l01-016/l01-016-02.png, 1720, 79, charm when it suited him . The whole family 
Lines/l01/l01-016/l01-016-03.png, 1774, 57, came to like him . The real Michael - he was the 
Lines/l01/l01-016/l01-016-04.png, 1782, 72, same age as my son - died of pleurisy when he 
Lines/l01/l01-016/l01-016-05.png, 1733, 69, was eighteen . Soon after that Pete staged his 
Lines/l01/l01-016/l01-016-06.png, 332, 78, drowning . 
Lines/l01/l01-129/l01-129-00.png, 1885, 83, Fred fixed his small eyes on his brother , beckoned 
Lines/l01/l01-129/l01-129-01.png, 1829, 75, him to stand closer , and whispered into his 
Lines/l01/l01-129/l01-129-02.png, 1752, 71, ear the most unexpected words Nick had 
Lines/l01/l01-129/l01-129-03.png, 1588, 103, ever heard . " I 'm going to get myself 
Lines/l01/l01-129/l01-129-04.png, 1601, 83, married , " Fred said . The next day he 
Lines/l01/l01-129/l01-129-05.png, 1675, 103, brought home a woman in her middle 
Lines/l01/l01-129/l01-129-06.png, 1519, 102, thirties and took her straight to his 
Lines/l01/l01-129/l01-129-07.png, 714, 50, mother's bedside . 
Lines/l01/l01-195/l01-195-00.png, 1882, 99, " Imagine it , Nick , just that bit of information 
Lines/l01/l01-195/l01-195-01.png, 1897, 105, Fred picked up about Pete Jesty always touching 
Lines/l01/l01-195/l01-195-02.png, 1794, 89, his nose , and me remembering from that 
Lines/l01/l01-195/l01-195-03.png, 1854, 75, snap you once showed me that this Cax- 
Lines/l01/l01-195/l01-195-04.png, 1823, 73, ton had some sort of a scar there . Just 
Lines/l01/l01-195/l01-195-05.png, 1836, 83, an idea to begin with , mind you - then 
Lines/l01/l01-195/l01-195-06.png, 1789, 95, click ! and I 'd got it . That was smart 
Lines/l01/l01-195/l01-195-07.png, 1265, 104, work , say what you like . " 
Lines/l01/l01-199/l01-199-00.png, 1819, 156, " It certainly was , Sam , " Nick would agree , and go 
Lines/l01/l01-199/l01-199-01.png, 1756, 144, on to say with a touch of self-importance : " No 
Lines/l01/l01-199/l01-199-02.png, 1855, 110, wonder he tried to have me suffocated back 
Lines/l01/l01-199/l01-199-03.png, 1746, 135, last summer . Must have thought I 'd 
Lines/l01/l01-199/l01-199-04.png, 1799, 134, rumbled him right from the start . " By this 
Lines/l01/l01-199/l01-199-05.png, 1759, 96, time Nick was certain in his own mind 
Lines/l01/l01-199/l01-199-06.png, 1758, 127, that he had really seen Caxton's hand 
Lines/l01/l01-199/l01-199-07.png, 1827, 139, snatching at the prop holding the barge's 
Lines/l01/l01-199/l01-199-08.png, 1901, 123, hatch open , though he could never prove it , 
Lines/l01/l01-199/l01-199-09.png, 1761, 102, and it would not be of much use if 
Lines/l01/l01-199/l01-199-10.png, 489, 81, he could . 
Lines/l01/l01-143/l01-143-00.png, 1750, 111, It was Nick who found the answer . " Only 
Lines/l01/l01-143/l01-143-01.png, 1816, 116, one thing for it , Mum , " he said , sitting on 
Lines/l01/l01-143/l01-143-02.png, 1831, 126, the edge of the bed and holding one 
Lines/l01/l01-143/l01-143-03.png, 1752, 127, of her hands in his . " Let Fred and 
Lines/l01/l01-143/l01-143-04.png, 1665, 135, Mag have the two upstairs rooms 
Lines/l01/l01-143/l01-143-05.png, 1735, 107, between them . Sam will have to 
Lines/l01/l01-143/l01-143-06.png, 1305, 111, come out of his kennel . 
Lines/l01/l01-000/l01-000-00.png, 1751, 184, He did well . He got in touch with 
Lines/l01/l01-000/l01-000-01.png, 1921, 212, the woman Pete was passing off as his 
Lines/l01/l01-000/l01-000-02.png, 1876, 203, mother . Starmouth managed to 
Lines/l01/l01-000/l01-000-03.png, 2010, 178, win her confidence . It seems that 
Lines/l01/l01-000/l01-000-04.png, 2039, 183, she was an honest enough woman , 
Lines/l01/l01-000/l01-000-05.png, 1903, 195, only her mind wasn't as clear as 
Lines/l01/l01-000/l01-000-06.png, 1833, 137, it could have been . She showed 
Lines/l01/l01-000/l01-000-07.png, 1909, 219, him photographs . He found out 
Lines/l01/l01-000/l01-000-08.png, 2062, 149, that the name of her house - Grand 
Lines/l01/l01-000/l01-000-09.png, 1859, 223, Greve - was taken from a bay 
Lines/l01/l01-000/l01-000-10.png, 1908, 212, in one of the Channel Islands . 
Lines/l01/l01-082/l01-082-00.png, 1850, 131, " Another was the body fetching up on the mooring-hook - practically where 
Lines/l01/l01-082/l01-082-01.png, 1819, 131, it started from . " " And you finding out about the spy at the Marshams' , 
Lines/l01/l01-082/l01-082-02.png, 1727, 118, " Passon said . " Just a stroke of luck , sir , " Tong said . " Luck or not , 
Lines/l01/l01-082/l01-082-03.png, 1811, 130, Harry , it was the real turning-point for us . Must be true what they 
Lines/l01/l01-082/l01-082-04.png, 837, 124, say . ' Tong can't go wrong ! ' " 
Lines/l01/l01-105/l01-105-00.png, 1707, 126, With Grace helpless Rose set up her 
Lines/l01/l01-105/l01-105-01.png, 1754, 122, own autocracy . Her squeaking , querulous 
Lines/l01/l01-105/l01-105-02.png, 1608, 81, accents were heard without inter- 
Lines/l01/l01-105/l01-105-03.png, 1809, 123, mission . They rose over the baby's inter- 
Lines/l01/l01-105/l01-105-04.png, 1786, 98, minable howling and were directed at 
Lines/l01/l01-105/l01-105-05.png, 1751, 124, everyone in equal measure . She was 
Lines/l01/l01-105/l01-105-06.png, 1805, 105, a poor and unpunctual cook . Normally 
Lines/l01/l01-105/l01-105-07.png, 1798, 102, indolent , she was now and again seized 
Lines/l01/l01-105/l01-105-08.png, 1719, 109, with unpredictable bouts of energy in 
Lines/l01/l01-105/l01-105-09.png, 1814, 122, the grip of which she swept through 
Lines/l01/l01-105/l01-105-10.png, 1867, 123, the house with a fury that disarranged 
Lines/l01/l01-187/l01-187-00.png, 1949, 118, " She 's as good a worker as you could wish for . 
Lines/l01/l01-187/l01-187-01.png, 1809, 106, She speaks our language . Mag 's one of us . " 
Lines/l01/l01-187/l01-187-02.png, 1815, 112, Nick and his grandfather shared their bedroom 
Lines/l01/l01-187/l01-187-03.png, 1774, 124, amicably . The old man , though fighting a 
Lines/l01/l01-187/l01-187-04.png, 1918, 131, grumbling rearguard action , permitted himself 
Lines/l01/l01-187/l01-187-05.png, 1811, 133, gradually to become a little cleaner and 
Lines/l01/l01-187/l01-187-06.png, 1813, 100, tidier . In his heart he was well satisfied to 
Lines/l01/l01-187/l01-187-07.png, 1842, 133, have Nick's company . When they were alone 
Lines/l01/l01-187/l01-187-08.png, 1740, 118, together he often explained all over again 
Lines/l01/l01-187/l01-187-09.png, 1750, 121, how shrewd he had been in discovering 
Lines/l01/l01-187/l01-187-10.png, 758, 130, Alf Jesty's secret . 
Lines/l01/l01-065/l01-065-00.png, 1652, 139, Carol Carstairs , interviewed by 
Lines/l01/l01-065/l01-065-01.png, 1872, 147, Passon and Tong for the second time , 
Lines/l01/l01-065/l01-065-02.png, 1758, 143, began by agreeing that she could 
Lines/l01/l01-065/l01-065-03.png, 1597, 88, have been mistaken about the 
Lines/l01/l01-065/l01-065-04.png, 1776, 135, precise minute of Dackson's visit 
Lines/l01/l01-065/l01-065-05.png, 1798, 125, the previous Wednesday , and ended 
Lines/l01/l01-065/l01-065-06.png, 1745, 213, by admitting that he was in fact 
Lines/l01/l01-065/l01-065-07.png, 1586, 165, at least half an hour late for 
Lines/l01/l01-065/l01-065-08.png, 1727, 168, his appointment with her . " There 
Lines/l01/l01-065/l01-065-09.png, 1417, 111, it is , " Passon commented 
Lines/l01/l01-065/l01-065-10.png, 1577, 197, afterwards . " She is a business 
Lines/l01/l01-065/l01-065-11.png, 343, 55, woman . 
Lines/l07/l07-085/l07-085-00.png, 1713, 100, " And I can't allow that , " I said . 
Lines/l07/l07-085/l07-085-01.png, 1791, 118, " Deadlock , " said Max . " No , it isn't . 
Lines/l07/l07-085/l07-085-02.png, 1868, 124, I 'm determined to go , and by myself , 
Lines/l07/l07-085/l07-085-03.png, 1887, 121, whatever you say . " " I was afraid of 
Lines/l07/l07-085/l07-085-04.png, 1876, 107, that . " He sounded resigned but none 
Lines/l07/l07-085/l07-085-05.png, 1823, 118, the less hopeful . " You 're a very 
Lines/l07/l07-085/l07-085-06.png, 1768, 120, wilful woman but I 'll change 
Lines/l07/l07-085/l07-085-07.png, 1829, 119, your mind for you one of these 
Lines/l07/l07-085/l07-085-08.png, 288, 103, days . 
Lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-00.png, 1721, 106, It was a warm , still evening ; the plop of 
Lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-01.png, 1829, 121, fish and the gentle putter of the engine 
Lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-02.png, 1847, 117, were infinitely soothing after city noises , 
Lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-03.png, 1844, 128, and I began to look forward to my life 
Lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-04.png, 1762, 99, on the water . At last he pronounced 
Lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-05.png, 1902, 102, me riverworthy and wanted to know when 
Lines/l07/l07-138/l07-138-06.png, 1053, 124, I would be moving in . 
Lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-00.png, 1800, 83, He has done so many things that there 
Lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-01.png, 1761, 97, is always something new and exciting to 
Lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-02.png, 1664, 75, discover about him . " You 're wonderful , " I 
Lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-03.png, 1811, 105, said , meaning it . He pressed the tip of my 
Lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-04.png, 1855, 101, nose with one finger . " That makes two of us . " 
Lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-05.png, 1844, 106, It was about eight o'clock in the evening 
Lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-06.png, 1660, 71, when we tied up almost exactly opposite 
Lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-07.png, 1635, 93, Hardy's garden and went up on to the 
Lines/l07/l07-181/l07-181-08.png, 1808, 87, roof of the cabin to see what we could see . 
Lines/l07/l07-080/l07-080-00.png, 1921, 110, " You can't very well stop me . " " I can 
Lines/l07/l07-080/l07-080-01.png, 1826, 99, do better than that . If we were to 
Lines/l07/l07-080/l07-080-02.png, 1765, 110, get married now I could come 
Lines/l07/l07-080/l07-080-03.png, 1765, 124, with you . " I looked down at my 
Lines/l07/l07-080/l07-080-04.png, 1821, 104, plate , not daring to let him see 
Lines/l07/l07-080/l07-080-05.png, 1782, 128, how much the idea appealed to 
Lines/l07/l07-080/l07-080-06.png, 1865, 131, me , reminding myself that he could 
Lines/l07/l07-080/l07-080-07.png, 1737, 135, only have said such a thing 
Lines/l07/l07-080/l07-080-08.png, 1765, 112, because he did not know the 
Lines/l07/l07-080/l07-080-09.png, 741, 103, whole truth . 
Lines/l07/l07-190/l07-190-00.png, 1741, 89, " You won't see anyone tonight , it 's too late , " Max 
Lines/l07/l07-190/l07-190-01.png, 1775, 88, said and turned to go . " No - wait , " I put out a 
Lines/l07/l07-190/l07-190-02.png, 1846, 107, hand to stop him . The sun was no longer shining 
Lines/l07/l07-190/l07-190-03.png, 1763, 106, and it was dark across there by the trees , 
Lines/l07/l07-190/l07-190-04.png, 1767, 90, but I thought I had seen something move . 
Lines/l07/l07-052/l07-052-00.png, 1824, 94, " Why ? " he asked again . " I can tell by your voice that it means 
Lines/l07/l07-052/l07-052-01.png, 1841, 104, a lot to you , but I 'm damned if I can see the reason . It 's not as 
Lines/l07/l07-052/l07-052-02.png, 1848, 103, if you were all that fond of Alice . " He was interrupted by the 
Lines/l07/l07-052/l07-052-03.png, 1777, 118, arrival of the food and wine . When the pouring ritual was over he 
Lines/l07/l07-052/l07-052-04.png, 277, 52, went on : 
Lines/l07/l07-118/l07-118-00.png, 1764, 106, Ten minutes later he stopped in a lane 
Lines/l07/l07-118/l07-118-01.png, 1591, 88, and helped me out with the same 
Lines/l07/l07-118/l07-118-02.png, 1935, 129, careful courtesy . " What sort of boat is it ? " 
Lines/l07/l07-118/l07-118-03.png, 1782, 104, I asked . " She , " he corrected . " She 's a 
Lines/l07/l07-118/l07-118-04.png, 1886, 123, converted life-boat . Not a very good one , 
Lines/l07/l07-118/l07-118-05.png, 1552, 116, but she 's sound enough and the 
Lines/l07/l07-118/l07-118-06.png, 625, 118, engine 's fine . " 
Lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-00.png, 1664, 106, Clive - he insisted on being called Clive - 
Lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-01.png, 1746, 108, haggled with him and within half an hour 
Lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-02.png, 1832, 115, Sandpiper was mine for three hundred and 
Lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-03.png, 1788, 120, fifty pounds . When all the business details 
Lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-04.png, 1583, 89, had been settled and the owner had 
Lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-05.png, 1748, 111, departed with my cheque in his pocket , 
Lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-06.png, 1867, 123, Clive started the engine and gave me my 
Lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-07.png, 1851, 129, first lesson in manoeuvring up and down 
Lines/l07/l07-135/l07-135-08.png, 1740, 100, the river and in and out of the other boats . 
Lines/l07/l07-103/l07-103-00.png, 1884, 124, " You can see it any time you like , " 
Lines/l07/l07-103/l07-103-01.png, 1853, 99, he told me . " The sooner the better . 
Lines/l07/l07-103/l07-103-02.png, 1861, 122, If you can get to Bletcham this 
Lines/l07/l07-103/l07-103-03.png, 1880, 107, evening I 'll run you up there 
Lines/l07/l07-103/l07-103-04.png, 1911, 118, in the car . " " That 's very nice of 
Lines/l07/l07-103/l07-103-05.png, 1822, 135, you . " " Nice , nothing . I told you , 
Lines/l07/l07-103/l07-103-06.png, 1721, 120, I 'm mad about boats . Seven 
Lines/l07/l07-103/l07-103-07.png, 848, 116, thirty do you ? 
Lines/l07/l07-065/l07-065-00.png, 1853, 89, If he didn't do it it must have been - " " Must have been 
Lines/l07/l07-065/l07-065-01.png, 1816, 105, who ? " Max prompted . I looked into his eyes and longed 
Lines/l07/l07-065/l07-065-02.png, 1732, 87, with all my heart to tell him , but I could not do it . 
Lines/l07/l07-065/l07-065-03.png, 1887, 103, As long as my suspicion remained in my head I could pretend 
Lines/l07/l07-065/l07-065-04.png, 1798, 100, to myself , in moments of optimism , that it was not true . 
Lines/l07/l07-176/l07-176-00.png, 1736, 82, " How on earth do you know all this ? " I asked 
Lines/l07/l07-176/l07-176-01.png, 1725, 84, him . " I used to play about in these things 
Lines/l07/l07-176/l07-176-02.png, 1838, 91, when I was a kid . And then I acted as guide 
Lines/l07/l07-176/l07-176-03.png, 1826, 106, on a river boat one summer , to keep myself 
Lines/l07/l07-176/l07-176-04.png, 1794, 96, going between terms at college . " It was 
Lines/l07/l07-176/l07-176-05.png, 1715, 96, the first I had heard of it , but that 's 
Lines/l07/l07-176/l07-176-06.png, 1589, 87, one of the things I like about Max . 
Lines/l07/l07-111/l07-111-00.png, 1919, 130, I could meet you at the bus station . " 
Lines/l07/l07-111/l07-111-01.png, 1889, 115, " No , " I said , " outside your office . " 
Lines/l07/l07-111/l07-111-02.png, 1900, 117, I could not endure the thought 
Lines/l07/l07-111/l07-111-03.png, 1930, 136, of another wait at the bus station . 
Lines/l07/l07-111/l07-111-04.png, 1915, 144, He was there punctually . Dressed 
Lines/l07/l07-111/l07-111-05.png, 1969, 119, in a loud tartan shirt and abbreviated 
Lines/l07/l07-111/l07-111-06.png, 1934, 116, shorts he looked hardly more than 
Lines/l07/l07-111/l07-111-07.png, 1908, 127, a boy , a cheerful , good-natured 
Lines/l07/l07-111/l07-111-08.png, 1826, 125, boy . He settled me into the car 
Lines/l07/l07-111/l07-111-09.png, 1795, 134, with touching care and then 
Lines/l07/l07-111/l07-111-10.png, 1692, 138, drove like a fiend along 
Lines/l07/l07-111/l07-111-11.png, 992, 105, the river road . 
Lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-00.png, 1861, 112, From this side , Rivermead was less forbidding ; 
Lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-01.png, 1701, 94, it stood a long way back from the water 
Lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-02.png, 1738, 95, at the end of a velvety lawn flanked with 
Lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-03.png, 1780, 104, flowering trees and shrubs . To the right of 
Lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-04.png, 1813, 83, the lawn , close to the water's edge , stood an 
Lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-05.png, 1747, 85, ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria ; it 
Lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-06.png, 1715, 73, was built across a narrow backwater 
Lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-07.png, 1727, 79, and there was a delicate iron staircase 
Lines/l07/l07-187/l07-187-08.png, 1791, 102, climbing the outer wall to a room above . 
Lines/l07/l07-074/l07-074-00.png, 1768, 115, If you 're right , you may be in serious danger from Hardy . 
Lines/l07/l07-074/l07-074-01.png, 1859, 99, Even if you 're wrong you 'll most certainly be in danger when 
Lines/l07/l07-074/l07-074-02.png, 1838, 99, you start handling a boat . " He picked up his glass and 
Lines/l07/l07-074/l07-074-03.png, 1820, 104, held it in both hands , looking at me thoughtfully over the 
Lines/l07/l07-074/l07-074-04.png, 1961, 122, top of it . " No , " he said at last . " I can't allow # # 
Lines/l07/l07-074/l07-074-05.png, 131, 74, it . " 
Lines/l07/l07-131/l07-131-00.png, 1689, 125, Inside , she was untidy and grubby but 
Lines/l07/l07-131/l07-131-01.png, 1806, 106, roomy enough and well lit by two rows of 
Lines/l07/l07-131/l07-131-02.png, 1843, 125, good-sized windows . It was a long time 
Lines/l07/l07-131/l07-131-03.png, 1546, 106, before I got used to calling them 
Lines/l07/l07-131/l07-131-04.png, 1844, 115, portholes . The owner was a middle-aged 
Lines/l07/l07-131/l07-131-05.png, 1647, 104, man whose family had tired of the 
Lines/l07/l07-131/l07-131-06.png, 1767, 104, limited excitement of the river and now 
Lines/l07/l07-131/l07-131-07.png, 1615, 123, had their eyes on a seagoing boat . 
Lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-00.png, 1739, 71, Like Clive , he was enthusiastic about the 
Lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-01.png, 1837, 97, engine and decided , apparently on the strength 
Lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-02.png, 1778, 84, of its efficiency , that Sandpiper was fit to 
Lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-03.png, 1818, 84, live in . I was more than thankful for his help 
Lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-04.png, 1848, 96, when we had installed my things and the 
Lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-05.png, 1873, 75, boat began to move . The river was crowded 
Lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-06.png, 1568, 83, with flocks of sailing boats which 
Lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-07.png, 1788, 94, swirled round us like gulls and there 
Lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-08.png, 1690, 101, were two locks to negotiate , but Max 
Lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-09.png, 1677, 96, seemed to know exactly what to do 
Lines/l07/l07-172/l07-172-10.png, 1790, 99, and at the same time kept me supplied 
Lines/g01/g01-004/g01-004-00.png, 1664, 113, It was naturally a highly popular victory with the 
Lines/g01/g01-004/g01-004-01.png, 1718, 96, Londoners , but it brought heavy censure from nobles 
Lines/g01/g01-004/g01-004-02.png, 1713, 98, who still believed that they had a monopoly of 
Lines/g01/g01-004/g01-004-03.png, 1654, 94, leadership . But , at last , Gaunt sailed . Opposing 
Lines/g01/g01-004/g01-004-04.png, 1654, 64, him was the French Admiral , Jean de Vienne - 
Lines/g01/g01-004/g01-004-05.png, 1289, 100, a great sailor and an able strategist . 
Lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-00.png, 1601, 171, In addition to these revenues , the King had the 
Lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-01.png, 1855, 117, financial benefits of his position at the head 
Lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-02.png, 1835, 165, of the feudal system , as its chief landowner 
Lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-03.png, 1909, 160, and the recipient of the fines of royal justice . 
Lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-04.png, 1900, 130, It was , therefore , a complicated and not very 
Lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-05.png, 1816, 156, satisfactory financial system in which the 
Lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-06.png, 1880, 125, borders between private and public purse were 
Lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-07.png, 1758, 116, as ill-defined as the borders between private 
Lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-08.png, 1910, 110, and national war , and in which the comparati- 
Lines/g01/g01-045/g01-045-09.png, 1891, 156, vely simple obligations of the feudal pyramid 
Lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-00.png, 1764, 113, Again the resentment was widespread and 
Lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-01.png, 1745, 101, the results disappointing - a tax estimated 
Lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-02.png, 1748, 102, to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000 . 
Lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-03.png, 1674, 104, In the following year , 1380 , the last and 
Lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-04.png, 1781, 114, most notorious third poll-tax was agreed 
Lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-05.png, 1822, 122, by a Parliament which met at Northampton . 
Lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-06.png, 1817, 109, There were dark reasons for a meeting so 
Lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-07.png, 1788, 125, far away from the capital in a town with 
Lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-08.png, 1760, 108, poor communications and not over supplied 
Lines/g01/g01-070/g01-070-09.png, 1309, 121, with hostelries and lodgings . 
Lines/g01/g01-034/g01-034-00.png, 1638, 79, When ' his ' war did not bring victory and 
Lines/g01/g01-034/g01-034-01.png, 1662, 87, booty , a new group of Lords might oust 
Lines/g01/g01-034/g01-034-02.png, 1729, 73, the unsuccessful leaders , and the Commons , 
Lines/g01/g01-034/g01-034-03.png, 1774, 78, who usually supplied the hard cash , might 
Lines/g01/g01-034/g01-034-04.png, 1812, 78, be bold enough to demand the production of 
Lines/g01/g01-034/g01-034-05.png, 1816, 68, accounts , and even at times the impeachment of 
Lines/g01/g01-034/g01-034-06.png, 1733, 59, the unsuccessful . But the Commons were not 
Lines/g01/g01-034/g01-034-07.png, 1766, 72, the people , and even a full Parliament was 
Lines/g01/g01-034/g01-034-08.png, 1478, 68, not yet a true mirror of the nation . 
Lines/g01/g01-000/g01-000-00.png, 1674, 112, A Scottish knight - Sir John Mercer - was 
Lines/g01/g01-000/g01-000-01.png, 1650, 140, imprisoned in England . His son , in revenge , was 
Lines/g01/g01-000/g01-000-02.png, 1703, 133, harrying English shipping as far away as Cherbourg , 
Lines/g01/g01-000/g01-000-03.png, 1624, 126, and doing it to some purpose . John Philpot , 
Lines/g01/g01-000/g01-000-04.png, 1623, 111, one of that new class of merchant financiers 
Lines/g01/g01-000/g01-000-05.png, 1790, 123, which the city of London was now producing , fitted , 
Lines/g01/g01-000/g01-000-06.png, 1745, 110, equipped and manned a fleet from his own 
Lines/g01/g01-000/g01-000-07.png, 1713, 105, resources , and captured the young Mercer in a 
Lines/g01/g01-000/g01-000-08.png, 874, 107, brilliant Channel fight . 
Lines/g01/g01-008/g01-008-00.png, 1711, 98, Obedient to the policy of his King , de Vienne avoided 
Lines/g01/g01-008/g01-008-01.png, 1729, 87, trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it 
Lines/g01/g01-008/g01-008-02.png, 1784, 100, on land . Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for 
Lines/g01/g01-008/g01-008-03.png, 1754, 74, an elusive foe , and , afraid to return home without 
Lines/g01/g01-008/g01-008-04.png, 1765, 97, something to show , he foolishly attempted to besiege 
Lines/g01/g01-008/g01-008-05.png, 1594, 85, the well-protected fortress of St Malo . This 
Lines/g01/g01-008/g01-008-06.png, 1704, 91, involved the dreary method of mining operations in 
Lines/g01/g01-008/g01-008-07.png, 1694, 86, which Gaunt , under the Black Prince , had shown 
Lines/g01/g01-008/g01-008-08.png, 1418, 91, considerable skill at the siege of Limoges . 
Lines/g01/g01-019/g01-019-00.png, 1867, 154, It seems obvious that if an expedition to 
Lines/g01/g01-019/g01-019-01.png, 2008, 197, Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais , 
Lines/g01/g01-019/g01-019-02.png, 1994, 167, then the primary essential to the success 
Lines/g01/g01-019/g01-019-03.png, 2094, 198, of the French war was a navy in unquestioned 
Lines/g01/g01-019/g01-019-04.png, 2042, 158, command of the Channel . It seems obvious 
Lines/g01/g01-019/g01-019-05.png, 1801, 220, that divided forces were dissipating the 
Lines/g01/g01-019/g01-019-06.png, 2098, 190, advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included 
Lines/g01/g01-019/g01-019-07.png, 1950, 194, Calais , Cherbourg , Brest , Bordeaux and Bayonne , 
Lines/g01/g01-019/g01-019-08.png, 2028, 167, and that there was no hope of final victory 
Lines/g01/g01-019/g01-019-09.png, 1976, 167, without a large-scale and concentrated invasion . 
Lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-00.png, 1850, 126, A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure 
Lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-01.png, 1841, 90, to mediaeval eyes . It was determined that 100,000 
Lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-02.png, 1888, 118, was a fairer target , and the Parliament agreed to find 
Lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-03.png, 1941, 126, two-thirds of this sum providing the clergy supplied 
Lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-04.png, 1865, 103, the remainder . The method of assessment to which the 
Lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-05.png, 2067, 137, Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax . The manifest 
Lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-06.png, 1991, 135, injustice of this method had been to a certain degree 
Lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-07.png, 2035, 106, corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax , 
Lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-08.png, 1987, 123, but this lesson was ignored , and the injustice trebled in 
Lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-09.png, 2007, 133, weight by a flat-rate tax at treble the rate - every adult 
Lines/g01/g01-083/g01-083-10.png, 1975, 118, had to pay three groats , but this time an adult was re- 
Lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-00.png, 1783, 127, There were two other sources of public revenue - 
Lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-01.png, 1833, 138, first , the Church , which wisely followed the lead 
Lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-02.png, 1772, 114, of the Commons and in its own Convocations 
Lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-03.png, 1865, 172, granted equivalent contributions , and second , 
Lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-04.png, 1811, 152, the foreign merchants , with whom the King's 
Lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-05.png, 1770, 197, officials had formerly made private bargains 
Lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-06.png, 1706, 119, at ' colloquies of merchants ' , and whose 
Lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-07.png, 1849, 145, payments were now authorized by parliamentary 
Lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-08.png, 1769, 154, sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in 
Lines/g01/g01-043/g01-043-09.png, 1702, 104, excess of the rate for native merchants . 
Lines/g01/g01-039/g01-039-00.png, 1758, 130, None of these classes , except the yeomen , paid or 
Lines/g01/g01-039/g01-039-01.png, 1784, 179, expected to pay direct taxes . During the four- 
Lines/g01/g01-039/g01-039-02.png, 1763, 156, teenth century , the traditional methods of 
Lines/g01/g01-039/g01-039-03.png, 1852, 165, financing the Exchequer had become stabilized . 
Lines/g01/g01-039/g01-039-04.png, 1983, 188, When the King and his Council required additio- 
Lines/g01/g01-039/g01-039-05.png, 1949, 158, nal funds , they were usually granted an 
Lines/g01/g01-039/g01-039-06.png, 1853, 153, export tax on the wool trade , collected by 
Lines/g01/g01-039/g01-039-07.png, 2013, 168, means of that ' staple ' system which ensured that 
Lines/g01/g01-039/g01-039-08.png, 1931, 158, prices , quality and tax could be efficiently su- 
Lines/g01/g01-039/g01-039-09.png, 1906, 145, pervised and controlled , together with a 
Lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-00.png, 1803, 97, London was again in turmoil ; but this time 
Lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-01.png, 1808, 104, over a question of trade rivalry . A rich mer- 
Lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-02.png, 1802, 88, chant from Genoa had been murdered , and 
Lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-03.png, 1790, 100, John de Kyrkby , a Londoner , was one of 
Lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-04.png, 1837, 120, those charged with the crime . It is clear 
Lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-05.png, 1821, 83, from the chronicles that this was a sordid 
Lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-06.png, 1861, 101, quarrel between monopolists and interlopers . 
Lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-07.png, 1813, 129, The city merchants were jealous of foreign 
Lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-08.png, 1785, 117, merchants who could tempt court and 
Lines/g01/g01-074/g01-074-09.png, 1821, 107, baronage with rarer luxuries than those 
Lines/g01/g01-037/g01-037-00.png, 1557, 86, The people - Langland's ' folk ' and Gaunt's 
Lines/g01/g01-037/g01-037-01.png, 1608, 62, ' knaves ' - were villeins still tied to the 
Lines/g01/g01-037/g01-037-02.png, 1733, 82, feudal obligations of work or villeins who 
Lines/g01/g01-037/g01-037-03.png, 1679, 82, had bought their release , free labourers 
Lines/g01/g01-037/g01-037-04.png, 1639, 82, who worked for the highest bidders , free 
Lines/g01/g01-037/g01-037-05.png, 1777, 80, yeomen who had prospered enough to become 
Lines/g01/g01-037/g01-037-06.png, 1726, 75, successful farmers , the artisans , craftsmen , 
Lines/g01/g01-037/g01-037-07.png, 1642, 81, journeymen and small tradesmen of the 
Lines/g01/g01-037/g01-037-08.png, 1754, 71, towns , and the retainers and men-at-arms 
Lines/g01/g01-037/g01-037-09.png, 1197, 79, in the pay of landed Lords . 
Lines/g01/g01-012/g01-012-00.png, 1985, 173, When all seemed to be going well , a sortie surprised 
Lines/g01/g01-012/g01-012-01.png, 1975, 153, moment had charge of the mine ; the mine collapsed 
Lines/g01/g01-012/g01-012-02.png, 1894, 161, fame and glory . Gaunt was compelled to return 
Lines/g01/g01-012/g01-012-03.png, 1854, 146, even despised failure . The ' ribald ' Londoners , who 
Lines/g01/g01-012/g01-012-04.png, 1883, 195, Hawley , were also expressing their disappointment 
Lines/g01/g01-012/g01-012-05.png, 1858, 174, comparing the failure of a subsidized duke 
Lines/g01/g01-012/g01-012-06.png, 263, 179, citizen . 
Lines/g01/g01-025/g01-025-00.png, 1620, 108, In this cruel process which was 
Lines/g01/g01-025/g01-025-01.png, 1719, 103, hammering out nations on the anvils of 
Lines/g01/g01-025/g01-025-02.png, 1697, 92, war , there was a constant stirring of 
Lines/g01/g01-025/g01-025-03.png, 1805, 88, those in authority to find some simple 
Lines/g01/g01-025/g01-025-04.png, 1719, 105, way out of the complicated financial 
Lines/g01/g01-025/g01-025-05.png, 1826, 92, 6impasse which always resulted , and in the 
Lines/g01/g01-025/g01-025-06.png, 1856, 88, story of the experiments and expedients 
Lines/g01/g01-025/g01-025-07.png, 1741, 94, to which the Exchequer resorted is 
Lines/g01/g01-025/g01-025-08.png, 1570, 101, the story of the prelude to the 
Lines/g01/g01-025/g01-025-09.png, 1328, 93, Peasants' Revolt of 1381 . 
Lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-00.png, 1657, 158, Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple 
Lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-01.png, 1642, 132, arithmetic which argued that , as the first 
Lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-02.png, 1638, 113, poll-tax had supplied 22,000 , a tax of 
Lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-03.png, 1674, 120, three times the rate would produce 66,000 . 
Lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-04.png, 1678, 132, The only concession made in view of the 
Lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-05.png, 1679, 121, objections to the first two poll-taxes was 
Lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-06.png, 1737, 126, the suggestion that the rich should help 
Lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-07.png, 1700, 182, the poor - but this was only a pious hope 
Lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-08.png, 1615, 167, because no machinery was provided for 
Lines/g01/g01-088/g01-088-09.png, 1630, 179, carrying it into effect , and a subordinate 
Lines/g01/g01-016/g01-016-00.png, 1910, 158, These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide 
Lines/g01/g01-016/g01-016-01.png, 1932, 152, obvious morals for those who are judges long 
Lines/g01/g01-016/g01-016-02.png, 1861, 172, after the event . It seems obvious that , though 
Lines/g01/g01-016/g01-016-03.png, 1934, 180, the longbows of yeomen could pierce the 
Lines/g01/g01-016/g01-016-04.png, 1976, 154, plate and mail of French knights , a brilliant 
Lines/g01/g01-016/g01-016-05.png, 1964, 166, battle was no substitute for a sound policy , 
Lines/g01/g01-016/g01-016-06.png, 2043, 184, and that , if archers had no target , campaigns 
Lines/g01/g01-016/g01-016-07.png, 1834, 175, became mere marauding route marches . 
Lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-00.png, 1830, 109, But this time there was a very interesting 
Lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-01.png, 1770, 120, attempt to apply a sliding scale to the 
Lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-02.png, 1832, 116, payments demanded . The definition of an 
Lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-03.png, 1799, 116, adult was altered to read ' over sixteen ' , 
Lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-04.png, 1844, 115, and , where the poorest were to pay a groat , 
Lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-05.png, 1830, 117, the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops 
Lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-06.png, 1909, 111, of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks , 
Lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-07.png, 1913, 126, and between these two extremes a graduated 
Lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-08.png, 1637, 124, scale of payments was fixed for the 
Lines/g01/g01-067/g01-067-09.png, 1793, 128, different classes of laymen and clerics . 
Lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-00.png, 1647, 76, Social service as a function of government 
Lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-01.png, 1646, 75, was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its 
Lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-02.png, 1468, 65, substitute was the mutual self-help of 
Lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-03.png, 1627, 63, communities , whether those communities were 
Lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-04.png, 1670, 63, monasteries , manors , townships , or wards and 
Lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-05.png, 1517, 68, guilds of a city . A mediaeval tax was 
Lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-06.png, 1727, 72, therefore in essence a forced payment whose 
Lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-07.png, 1729, 66, return was the uncertain bounty of booty 
Lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-08.png, 1778, 81, and the vague advantages of military glory ; 
Lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-09.png, 1735, 87, it was therefore always granted grudgingly 
Lines/g01/g01-031/g01-031-10.png, 1841, 73, and coupled with the vain hope that , in the 
Lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-00.png, 1702, 113, In appreciating this story , modern con- 
Lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-01.png, 1774, 103, ceptions of governmental duties must be 
Lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-02.png, 1762, 110, set aside . A modern government needs 
Lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-03.png, 1771, 103, taxation not merely for defence and 
Lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-04.png, 1738, 111, offence but for a very wide range of 
Lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-05.png, 1764, 107, social services . A mediaeval oligarchy 
Lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-06.png, 1781, 88, needed taxation in order to supplement 
Lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-07.png, 1703, 99, the private wealth of the monarchy 
Lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-08.png, 1788, 90, ( the royal income from the revenues of 
Lines/g01/g01-027/g01-027-09.png, 1655, 96, crown lands , the fees of feudalism 
Lines/g01/g01-022/g01-022-00.png, 1745, 88, BUT NONE OF THESE DEDUCTIONS WERE 
Lines/g01/g01-022/g01-022-01.png, 1799, 78, DRAWN AT THE TIME , BECAUSE LARGE- 
Lines/g01/g01-022/g01-022-02.png, 1728, 81, SCALE WAR REQUIRED MONEY , AND 
Lines/g01/g01-022/g01-022-03.png, 1741, 70, THE CITIZENS WHO HAD THE MONEY 
Lines/g01/g01-022/g01-022-04.png, 1654, 68, WERE NOT YET SUFFICIENTLY AT 
Lines/g01/g01-022/g01-022-05.png, 1734, 72, ONE WITH NOBLES AND KING TO THINK

Lines/g01/g01-022/g01-022-07.png, 1549, 56, ANCING A RULING CLASS WHICH 
Lines/g01/g01-022/g01-022-08.png, 1831, 86, DESPISED THEM . THE COMMONS WERE 
Lines/g01/g01-022/g01-022-09.png, 1831, 66, GLAD ENOUGH TO ENJOY THE FRUITS 
Lines/l04/l04-136/l04-136-00.png, 1769, 93, It was impossible to associate him in one's mind with a 
Lines/l04/l04-136/l04-136-01.png, 1646, 102, cold-blooded murder but , in fact , Henry Mansell's 
Lines/l04/l04-136/l04-136-02.png, 1676, 120, death had saved the firm and Julian's future . 
Lines/l04/l04-136/l04-136-03.png, 1716, 112, Moreover he might well have been aware of his 
Lines/l04/l04-136/l04-136-04.png, 1714, 116, brother's intention to skip out of the country and 
Lines/l04/l04-136/l04-136-05.png, 1728, 120, passed on the information . ' I 'm sure you 're right ' , 
Lines/l04/l04-136/l04-136-06.png, 1705, 115, Hugh said thoughtfully . ' But whoever did it got 
Lines/l04/l04-136/l04-136-07.png, 1223, 117, clean away without being spotted . ' 
Lines/l04/l04-005/l04-005-00.png, 1742, 161, When at last he looked up she was standing right 
Lines/l04/l04-005/l04-005-01.png, 1971, 172, in front of him , smiling as if nothing had happened ! 
Lines/l04/l04-005/l04-005-02.png, 1943, 149, He could hardly believe it and blinked several times . 
Lines/l04/l04-005/l04-005-03.png, 2018, 170, ' Well , don't I get a drink tonight ? ' she asked boldly . 
Lines/l04/l04-005/l04-005-04.png, 1832, 152, ' Of course ... anything you like ' , he murmured , 
Lines/l04/l04-005/l04-005-05.png, 2011, 174, relief flooding over him . ' Kitty ... I 'm sorry ... . ' 
Lines/l04/l04-005/l04-005-06.png, 1886, 163, His throat went tight and words failed him . 
Lines/l04/l04-098/l04-098-00.png, 1778, 151, It would be safer under lock and key 
Lines/l04/l04-098/l04-098-01.png, 1695, 145, for the time being than behind a piece 
Lines/l04/l04-098/l04-098-02.png, 1814, 179, of panelling which did not fit very sec-

Lines/l04/l04-082/l04-082-02.png, 1913, 150, and virile competitor and he knew it . He turned 
Lines/l04/l04-082/l04-082-03.png, 1874, 201, away and begun to undress , shivering with the

Lines/l04/l04-026/l04-026-03.png, 1763, 96, and dogs and he knew that Harry didn't either . He waited ,

Lines/l04/l04-000/l04-000-02.png, 1824, 120, There was nothing to be said . He lifted his glass 
Lines/l04/l04-000/l04-000-03.png, 1887, 94, and drained it , feeling the sweat breaking out on the 
Lines/l04/l04-000/l04-000-04.png, 747, 76, palms of his hands .

Lines/l04/l04-020/l04-020-03.png, 1685, 105, waving her hand to him . Harry followed him to the 
Lines/l04/l04-020/l04-020-04.png, 1740, 97, door , opened it for him and stood outside on the step , 
Lines/l04/l04-020/l04-020-05.png, 1784, 94, looking up at the sky , where a few pale stars shone 
Lines/l04/l04-020/l04-020-06.png, 1306, 112, between puffs of light cumulus cloud . 
Lines/l04/l04-179/l04-179-00.png, 1834, 119, Hugh wasn't impressed with this ingratiating bar- 
Lines/l04/l04-179/l04-179-01.png, 1754, 106, man whom Roddy had raked up . He was seedy and

Lines/l04/l04-179/l04-179-04.png, 1824, 100, crafty expression that failed to inspire confidence . 
Lines/l04/l04-179/l04-179-05.png, 1759, 110, ' He was hitting the bottle pretty hard , sir ... ' the 
Lines/l04/l04-179/l04-179-06.png, 1811, 103, man said in a loud whisper . ' Meaning no offe-

Lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-00.png, 1912, 95, He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor 
Lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-01.png, 1841, 86, to count them . Of course , he remembered being in a great hurry to get 
Lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-02.png, 1813, 109, that fifty pounds for Kitty ! Obviously he had been careless in 
Lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-03.png, 1695, 109, replacing the panel , but the possibility of anyone having 
Lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-04.png, 1721, 93, discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a shock . 
Lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-05.png, 1734, 82, As he replaced the bundles of notes , he withdrew the tin 
Lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-06.png, 1625, 95, box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the 
Lines/l04/l04-093/l04-093-07.png, 280, 68, cupboard . 
Lines/l04/l04-113/l04-113-00.png, 1775, 117, ' O.K. , Roddy , whatever you say . ' Hugh drained his glass and 
Lines/l04/l04-113/l04-113-01.png, 1815, 102, ordered two more beers . ' I 'm really beginning to feel it 's 
Lines/l04/l04-113/l04-113-02.png, 1859, 83, all a bit of a waste of time , anyway . I 've been collecting 
Lines/l04/l04-113/l04-113-03.png, 1785, 106, scraps of evidence and piecing them together for four 
Lines/l04/l04-113/l04-113-04.png, 1787, 78, months now , and the whole lot still doesn't amount to 
Lines/l04/l04-113/l04-113-05.png, 1275, 79, anything one could call concrete . ' 
Lines/l04/l04-141/l04-141-00.png, 1822, 134, ' Easy enough along that stretch of coast road in winter , 
Lines/l04/l04-141/l04-141-01.png, 1831, 114, believe me ' , Roddy affirmed solemnly . ' He probably caught 
Lines/l04/l04-141/l04-141-02.png, 1863, 94, the next boat across the channel and has been lying low 
Lines/l04/l04-141/l04-141-03.png, 1872, 118, with the money somewhere . ' Hugh nodded . ' I realized that 
Lines/l04/l04-141/l04-141-04.png, 1940, 118, after my talk with Mrs. Lawford . There are a dozen countries 
Lines/l04/l04-141/l04-141-05.png, 1906, 121, where a man could easily hide up and change the money 
Lines/l04/l04-141/l04-141-06.png, 491, 109, without danger . 
Lines/l04/l04-012/l04-012-00.png, 1904, 171, ' Aw , forget it ' , she said cheerfully . ' I 'll sting 
Lines/l04/l04-012/l04-012-01.png, 1736, 155, you for a double for being a naughty boy . 
Lines/l04/l04-012/l04-012-02.png, 1725, 170, How about the telly tomorrow afternoon ? ' 
Lines/l04/l04-012/l04-012-03.png, 1856, 179, He felt a glow of happiness steal over him . 
Lines/l04/l04-012/l04-012-04.png, 1919, 213, Everything was all right now , thank God . She 
Lines/l04/l04-012/l04-012-05.png, 1828, 156, wasn't going to break with him , after all . 
Lines/l04/l04-012/l04-012-06.png, 2042, 176, For the moment it was the only thing in the 
Lines/l04/l04-012/l04-012-07.png, 952, 107, world that mattered . 
Lines/l04/l04-052/l04-052-00.png, 1730, 108, He paused , hatred of Stevie Hewitt 
Lines/l04/l04-052/l04-052-01.png, 1460, 140, rising like gall in his throat . 
Lines/l04/l04-052/l04-052-02.png, 1770, 164, ' And I 'll find a way of getting rid of 
Lines/l04/l04-052/l04-052-03.png, 1863, 110, that chap , Hewitt , too . Leave it to me . ' 
Lines/l04/l04-052/l04-052-04.png, 1822, 145, ' O.K. , Bob , but watch your step . He 's

Lines/l04/l04-052/l04-052-06.png, 1890, 95, said in a low voice . Bone half smiled 
Lines/l04/l04-052/l04-052-07.png, 1885, 90, in the darkness . ' I 'll remember ' , he said . 
Lines/l04/l04-052/l04-052-08.png, 1877, 154, ' Good night , Harry . ' ' Good night , Bob . ' 
Lines/l04/l04-147/l04-147-00.png, 1572, 122, Unless we can get a definite line on him it 's 
Lines/l04/l04-147/l04-147-01.png, 1801, 162, hopeless ... . ' ' Something will turn up one day , you 'll see ' , 
Lines/l04/l04-147/l04-147-02.png, 1811, 129, Roddy said confidently . ' If we plug away at the leads 
Lines/l04/l04-147/l04-147-03.png, 1844, 123, we have ... . ' ' If only the police would do something ... ' Hugh 
Lines/l04/l04-147/l04-147-04.png, 1698, 121, cried out in exasperation . ' I 've put everything I know 
Lines/l04/l04-147/l04-147-05.png, 497, 66, before them ... . ' 
Lines/l04/l04-087/l04-087-00.png, 1849, 114, Was it his imagination or was the panel slightly lop-sided ? 
Lines/l04/l04-087/l04-087-01.png, 1892, 94, Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong 
Lines/l04/l04-087/l04-087-02.png, 1857, 85, panel and pulled it out . The black tin box was exactly 
Lines/l04/l04-087/l04-087-03.png, 1888, 93, as he had left it . With heavily beating heart he reached 
Lines/l04/l04-087/l04-087-04.png, 1774, 110, out and lifted the lid . Everything was intact and he 
Lines/l04/l04-087/l04-087-05.png, 656, 96, gasped with relief . 
Lines/l04/l04-174/l04-174-00.png, 1819, 121, He wore a short white coat . Hugh ordered drinks . 
Lines/l04/l04-174/l04-174-01.png, 1731, 115, ' I was sorry to read about your dad in the 
Lines/l04/l04-174/l04-174-02.png, 1805, 109, paper ' , the man said to Hugh in a thick 
Lines/l04/l04-174/l04-174-03.png, 1842, 117, voice which bore traces of a cockney accent . 
Lines/l04/l04-174/l04-174-04.png, 1737, 142, ' I was telling your friend how he come 
Lines/l04/l04-174/l04-174-05.png, 1789, 120, in here the very night he passed away . ' 
Lines/l04/l04-124/l04-124-00.png, 1787, 122, Hugh nodded . His face wore the melancholy expression 
Lines/l04/l04-124/l04-124-01.png, 1694, 81, that was habitual to him but his eyes showed 
Lines/l04/l04-124/l04-124-02.png, 1757, 84, his inner excitement . ' I know , but from the 
Lines/l04/l04-124/l04-124-03.png, 1664, 78, moment he walked out of here we haven't a 
Lines/l04/l04-124/l04-124-04.png, 1723, 90, shred of evidence to prove what happened . 
Lines/l04/l04-124/l04-124-05.png, 1857, 83, Obviously he met someone , either by chance or 
Lines/l04/l04-124/l04-124-06.png, 1827, 96, by arrangement . Whichever way it was , that 
Lines/l04/l04-124/l04-124-07.png, 1934, 122, person had a gun and he managed to persuade 
Lines/l04/l04-124/l04-124-08.png, 1766, 133, Father to drive along that quiet stretch of

Lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-00.png, 1603, 112, When he closed his eyes it was 
Lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-01.png, 1597, 130, Henry Mansell's face he saw , hovering 
Lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-02.png, 1671, 101, above his head like a hideous caricature . The 
Lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-03.png, 1811, 128, parrot nose and straight line of the mouth , 
Lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-04.png, 1835, 158, the pitiless blue eyes that seemed to strip 
Lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-05.png, 1779, 158, him right down to his abjectly quaking 
Lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-06.png, 1658, 147, bones . The mouldering horror that had 
Lines/l04/l04-102/l04-102-07.png, 1794, 157, once been Henry Mansell taunted him

Lines/l04/l04-062/l04-062-03.png, 1630, 96, he concentrated on the problem of 
Lines/l04/l04-062/l04-062-04.png, 1830, 114, Stevie Hewitt . By comparison with the 
Lines/l04/l04-062/l04-062-05.png, 1707, 104, manner in which he had dispatched 
Lines/l04/l04-062/l04-062-06.png, 1652, 88, Henry Mansell the elimination of a

Lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-00.png, 1744, 122, Back at the cottage he prepared his supper and ate

Lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-02.png, 1689, 86, more on Kitty . If she was really in love with Stevie 
Lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-03.png, 1703, 96, Hewitt it was madness to go on worrying about her , he 
Lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-04.png, 1756, 84, told himself moodily . Yet it was not as clear-cut as that . 
Lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-05.png, 1777, 96, He not only felt his need of her but was equally aware 
Lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-06.png, 1704, 99, of the necessity to help and protect her , even against 
Lines/l04/l04-066/l04-066-07.png, 258, 65, her will .

Lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-00.png, 1554, 95, Tonight , for the first time , he had abandoned all

Lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-02.png, 1705, 96, for her . She had neither encouraged nor completely rejected 
Lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-03.png, 1779, 94, him . In some perverse way their brief quarrel had forged 
Lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-04.png, 1770, 86, a bond between them . No doubt she had every intention 
Lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-05.png, 1864, 100, of keeping both of them on a string . On the whole he probably 
Lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-06.png, 1782, 105, had a slight advantage over the young man , inasmuch as he 
Lines/l04/l04-071/l04-071-07.png, 1793, 105, had money to spend and she was a girl who had a healthy

Lines/l04/l04-118/l04-118-00.png, 1967, 126, Roddy puffed at his pipe , his eyes fixed on the white-coated

Lines/l04/l04-034/l04-034-08.png, 1826, 102, muttered . ' But it 's easier said than done .

Lines/a03/a03-080/a03-080-01.png, 1754, 76, today , however , that the Brussels Treaty 
Lines/a03/a03-080/a03-080-02.png, 1774, 62, was irrelevant , because research on the

Lines/a03/a03-080/a03-080-06.png, 1849, 65, to German participation is the absence of

Lines/a03/a03-014/a03-014-06.png, 1931, 188, was reported earlier in Laos that Prince

Lines/a03/a03-017/a03-017-02.png, 1699, 131, in Phnom Penh indicate that he still regards

Lines/a03/a03-017/a03-017-04.png, 1808, 132, Laos . His policy of strict neutrality from 1951 
Lines/a03/a03-017/a03-017-05.png, 1761, 142, to 1958 kept the kingdom in peace , though

Lines/a03/a03-047/a03-047-04.png, 1869, 118, impression remains that the Liberal leader 
Lines/a03/a03-047/a03-047-05.png, 1739, 125, is still the diplomatist , more at home

Lines/r03/r03-050/r03-050-03.png, 1749, 92, and yellow sleepy dust in the corners of his pale 
Lines/r03/r03-050/r03-050-04.png, 1719, 107, grey eyes . His finger-nails were dirty , though he 
Lines/r03/r03-050/r03-050-05.png, 1733, 106, tried to make up for it by constantly paring them 
Lines/r03/r03-050/r03-050-06.png, 1457, 94, with the finger-nail of the opposite hand . 
Lines/r03/r03-053/r03-053-00.png, 1738, 131, His voice was like his black and pin-stripe , 
Lines/r03/r03-053/r03-053-01.png, 1745, 132, a grey superimposition of respectability over

Lines/r03/r03-053/r03-053-03.png, 1787, 163, the result being somehow as ineffective , not 
Lines/r03/r03-053/r03-053-04.png, 1761, 139, just dusty-grey but muddy , slimy even . 
Lines/r03/r03-053/r03-053-05.png, 1702, 152, His digressions too , seemed to have no other 
Lines/r03/r03-053/r03-053-06.png, 1629, 141, purpose than the throwing of dust in his 
Lines/r03/r03-053/r03-053-07.png, 1782, 154, client's eyes , the dust of fake security , of 
Lines/r03/r03-053/r03-053-08.png, 1649, 135, the fake friend of the family , like the

Lines/r03/r03-096/r03-096-01.png, 1815, 92, than three thousand three fifty at the most . Now you 
Lines/r03/r03-096/r03-096-02.png, 1713, 115, could get quite a nice little semi-detached house in 
Lines/r03/r03-096/r03-096-03.png, 1807, 100, Grimstead for three thousand , that 's where I live , just

Lines/r03/r03-096/r03-096-05.png, 1635, 112, I forgot to tell you , we don't usually lend any 
Lines/r03/r03-096/r03-096-06.png, 1078, 89, house built earlier than 1918 . " 
Lines/r03/r03-030/r03-030-00.png, 1706, 125, The next thing that Serena discovered was that 
Lines/r03/r03-030/r03-030-01.png, 1815, 139, she could not afford to buy a house at all . 
Lines/r03/r03-030/r03-030-02.png, 1772, 152, And this in spite of having at last managed 
Lines/r03/r03-030/r03-030-03.png, 1785, 100, to save the ten percent needed . Or so she 
Lines/r03/r03-030/r03-030-04.png, 1818, 142, thought , being then in possession of what 
Lines/r03/r03-030/r03-030-05.png, 1900, 137, seemed to her the princely sum of six hund- 
Lines/r03/r03-030/r03-030-06.png, 1280, 138, red pounds . The lawyer said : 
Lines/r03/r03-084/r03-084-00.png, 1980, 184, I 'm afraid we can't take yours into account 
Lines/r03/r03-084/r03-084-01.png, 1983, 196, at all . It 's a rule of I.I.I. You see , you 
Lines/r03/r03-084/r03-084-02.png, 2025, 222, might stop work to have - well , for all sorts of 
Lines/r03/r03-084/r03-084-03.png, 1984, 177, reasons , or you might leave him . " " But how 
Lines/r03/r03-084/r03-084-04.png, 1926, 218, utterly extraordinary , " said Serena angrily , 
Lines/r03/r03-084/r03-084-05.png, 2037, 192, " you must be living in the nineteenth century . " 
Lines/r03/r03-084/r03-084-06.png, 1910, 244, " Oh , but it 's a very general rule , Mrs. Buttery , 
Lines/r03/r03-084/r03-084-07.png, 1897, 181, you 'll find that no insurance companies , 
Lines/r03/r03-084/r03-084-08.png, 1975, 192, or building societies , for that matter , will 
Lines/r03/r03-084/r03-084-09.png, 1445, 176, allow for the wife's earnings . 
Lines/r03/r03-002/r03-002-00.png, 1743, 164, In spite of all the transferred maternity 
Lines/r03/r03-002/r03-002-01.png, 1745, 133, she was endowed with by her patients , 
Lines/r03/r03-002/r03-002-02.png, 1830, 129, poor Serena was an infant-in-arms as 
Lines/r03/r03-002/r03-002-03.png, 1702, 134, a buyer of property . No , not even an 
Lines/r03/r03-002/r03-002-04.png, 1650, 103, infant-in-arms but a new-born babe , a 
Lines/r03/r03-002/r03-002-05.png, 1869, 130, premature piece of frailty in an oxygen- 
Lines/r03/r03-002/r03-002-06.png, 1841, 139, tent of utter innocence . The complexity of 
Lines/r03/r03-002/r03-002-07.png, 1823, 149, that innocence was colossal . It had layer 
Lines/r03/r03-002/r03-002-08.png, 1866, 163, after layer of illusion to be peeled off and 
Lines/r03/r03-002/r03-002-09.png, 1409, 140, replaced with sad knowledgeability . 
Lines/r03/r03-065/r03-065-00.png, 1876, 102, That 's rather the point , isn't it ? " " No , but I mean - " 
Lines/r03/r03-065/r03-065-01.png, 1834, 133, " I know what you mean . You may trust me , Mrs. 
Lines/r03/r03-065/r03-065-02.png, 1768, 122, Buttery . I think , however , that you might have 
Lines/r03/r03-065/r03-065-03.png, 1766, 109, to revise your ideas about - er - the type of 
Lines/r03/r03-065/r03-065-04.png, 1806, 140, property you intend to purchase . " She revised 
Lines/r03/r03-065/r03-065-05.png, 1797, 79, them . The little man from the Inter-Insular

Lines/r03/r03-065/r03-065-07.png, 480, 54, saw to that . 
Lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-00.png, 1841, 175, As they became known the Choir went to working- 
Lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-01.png, 1926, 201, men's clubs , to Conisborough on cheap trips to 
Lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-02.png, 1839, 173, sing to the miners , and sang for other organisations such 
Lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-03.png, 1895, 144, as the Bakers' Union , for whom they went on Satur- 
Lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-04.png, 1836, 177, day evenings to the Corner Pin Hotel , to rally 
Lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-05.png, 1787, 161, the members . The B.S.P. also rented pleasant rooms 
Lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-06.png, 1562, 206, on West Street , where a successful Sunday 
Lines/g03/g03-040/g03-040-07.png, 688, 120, school was held . 
Lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-00.png, 1825, 148, Although his ideas were diametrically opposed 
Lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-01.png, 1840, 170, to those of parsons he got on wonderfully well 
Lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-02.png, 1849, 144, with them , particularly those who , like the Rev. 
Lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-03.png, 1801, 156, Conrad Noel , the eloquent leader of 
Lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-04.png, 1883, 170, the Church Socialist League , genuinely advocated 
Lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-05.png, 1664, 134, socialism . With such men , who had the 
Lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-06.png, 1543, 168, courage of their convictions and their 
Lines/g03/g03-049/g03-049-07.png, 1879, 173, Christianity , common ground could be found .

Lines/g03/g03-064/g03-064-02.png, 1797, 147, and a gold purse in recognition of his

Lines/g03/g03-064/g03-064-04.png, 1773, 131, known to say that it was not ne- 
Lines/g03/g03-064/g03-064-05.png, 1789, 136, cessary to understand Marxism in order to 
Lines/g03/g03-064/g03-064-06.png, 1809, 120, understand socialism , though at this time 
Lines/g03/g03-064/g03-064-07.png, 1863, 108, he was a keen member of the B.S.P. . 
Lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-00.png, 1697, 145, This new party , the British Socialist Party , was 
Lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-01.png, 1708, 132, not prepared to accept the role of junior helper 
Lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-02.png, 1760, 154, in the Labour movement , or of only providing 
Lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-03.png, 1616, 165, propaganda in order to increase the volume of 
Lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-04.png, 1756, 164, socialist thought in the city , but sought to create 
Lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-05.png, 1764, 104, in the Labour movement a more militant attitude 
Lines/g03/g03-058/g03-058-06.png, 1752, 184, capable of achieving socialism for the working

Lines/a01/a01-058x/a01-058x-05.png, 1503, 169, enough . And he indicated that his

Lines/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-01.png, 1824, 76, cheered for a full minute - and even his 
Lines/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-02.png, 1721, 88, bitterest opponents on defence joined in . 
Lines/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-03.png, 1989, 96, Mr. Powell devoted half his speech to giving

Lines/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-06.png, 1908, 195, making progress . His basic defence of the 
Lines/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-07.png, 1830, 80, Health Service cuts was that " even after 
Lines/a01/a01-128u/a01-128u-08.png, 1824, 77, the proposed changes the net cost of the

Lines/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-04.png, 1998, 79, claimed was underpinning - not undermining - 
Lines/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-05.png, 1788, 90, the service . Answering the attack on

Lines/a01/a01-132u/a01-132u-07.png, 1830, 61, Powell said that all these foods would

Lines/a01/a01-020/a01-020-03.png, 1753, 128, to the Africans and Liberals attending . These 
Lines/a01/a01-020/a01-020-04.png, 1614, 114, plans do not give the Africans the overall

Lines/a01/a01-011/a01-011-03.png, 1723, 112, to discuss a common course of action . Sir Roy is 
Lines/a01/a01-011/a01-011-04.png, 1725, 108, violently opposed to Africans getting an elected majority 
Lines/a01/a01-011/a01-011-05.png, 1660, 106, in Northern Rhodesia , but the Colonial Secretary , 
Lines/a01/a01-011/a01-011-06.png, 1763, 112, Mr. Iain Macleod , is insisting on a policy of change . 
Lines/a01/a01-072x/a01-072x-00.png, 1514, 157, These support costs are a big drain on America's 
Lines/a01/a01-072x/a01-072x-01.png, 1378, 86, dollar reserves . Dr. Adenauer's answer is the 
Lines/a01/a01-072x/a01-072x-02.png, 1556, 146, once-and-for-all cash offer of 357million . President 
Lines/a01/a01-072x/a01-072x-03.png, 1501, 151, Kennedy's rejection of it is a painful blow to the

Lines/a01/a01-072x/a01-072x-05.png, 1514, 92, more - and increase taxation to do so - or 
Lines/a01/a01-072x/a01-072x-06.png, 1476, 136, run the obvious risks in upsetting the new

Lines/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-00.png, 1795, 90, The Press , many doctors and public were 
Lines/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-01.png, 1838, 95, denouncing the proposals . He quoted from 
Lines/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-02.png, 1871, 66, this letter which Mr. Gaitskell had received : 
Lines/a01/a01-096u/a01-096u-03.png, 1876, 91, " My background is a doctor of 68 , who

Lines/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-00.png, 1937, 68, He told them that their conception of social 
Lines/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-01.png, 1834, 82, services was wholly different - fundamentally 
Lines/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-02.png, 1939, 83, different from that of Labour . They would

Lines/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-04.png, 2115, 82, wretched - but it would not be too comfortable 
Lines/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-05.png, 1889, 95, nor too easy to get . Answering jeers that 
Lines/a01/a01-113u/a01-113u-06.png, 1873, 89, it was Labour which first put a ceiling

Lines/a01/a01-091/a01-091-06.png, 1573, 117, able to bear them . Mr. Brown 
Lines/a01/a01-091/a01-091-07.png, 1848, 166, declared that the policy under censure 
Lines/a01/a01-091/a01-091-08.png, 1810, 161, was monstrous . It had offended many 
Lines/a01/a01-091/a01-091-09.png, 1727, 196, people far beyond the ranks of Labour 
Lines/a01/a01-091/a01-091-10.png, 511, 154, supporters . 
Lines/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-00.png, 1938, 106, Though they may gather some Left-wing 
Lines/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-01.png, 1837, 103, support , a large majority of Labour

Lines/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-03.png, 1868, 96, Griffiths resolution . Mr. Foot's line will 
Lines/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-04.png, 1869, 103, be that as Labour M Ps opposed the 
Lines/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-05.png, 2000, 104, Government Bill which brought life peers 
Lines/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-06.png, 1995, 102, into existence , they should not now put

Lines/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-08.png, 1966, 81, House of Lords should be abolished and 
Lines/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-09.png, 1947, 91, that Labour should not take any steps 
Lines/a01/a01-003u/a01-003u-10.png, 2025, 107, which would appear to " prop up " an out- 
Lines/a01/a01-053x/a01-053x-00.png, 1522, 119, He said these concerned Mr. Weaver's alleged

Lines/a01/a01-053x/a01-053x-02.png, 1829, 170, Government . Immediately Mr. Kennedy rushed a letter 
Lines/a01/a01-053x/a01-053x-03.png, 1789, 134, to Senator Robertson saying the Federal Bureau 
Lines/a01/a01-053x/a01-053x-04.png, 1793, 135, of Investigation had reported on Mr. Weaver . 
Lines/a01/a01-053x/a01-053x-05.png, 1599, 154, He believed he would perform " outstanding 
Lines/a01/a01-053x/a01-053x-06.png, 1531, 140, service " in his post . Senator Robertson's 
Lines/a01/a01-053x/a01-053x-07.png, 1408, 115, committee has to pass Mr. Weaver's 
Lines/a01/a01-053x/a01-053x-08.png, 1793, 134, nomination before it can be considered by the 
Lines/a01/a01-053x/a01-053x-09.png, 482, 116, full Senate . 
Lines/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-00.png, 1683, 84, These support costs are a big drain on

Lines/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-02.png, 1742, 60, answer is the once-and-for-all cash 
Lines/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-03.png, 1828, 85, offer of 357million . President Kennedy's 
Lines/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-04.png, 1843, 88, rejection of it is a painful blow to the 
Lines/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-05.png, 1843, 70, West German Government . It will now have 
Lines/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-06.png, 1876, 73, to pay more - and increase taxation to do 
Lines/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-07.png, 1990, 92, so - or run the obvious # risks in upsetting 
Lines/a01/a01-072u/a01-072u-08.png, 1545, 63, the new American administration . 
Lines/a01/a01-117/a01-117-00.png, 1787, 136, In fact , the Tories made it worse now for the sick and 
Lines/a01/a01-117/a01-117-01.png, 1700, 126, needy than Labour had to make it in 1950 . And 
Lines/a01/a01-117/a01-117-02.png, 1552, 123, as a percentage of social service expenditure , 
Lines/a01/a01-117/a01-117-03.png, 1492, 125, health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent. 
Lines/a01/a01-117/a01-117-04.png, 1649, 162, Then Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the 
Lines/a01/a01-117/a01-117-05.png, 1662, 138, unsmiling Mr. Powell . He demanded that instead 
Lines/a01/a01-117/a01-117-06.png, 1668, 135, of taking it out of the patients Mr. Powell should 
Lines/a01/a01-117/a01-117-07.png, 1650, 159, take ruthless action against the drug making 
Lines/a01/a01-117/a01-117-08.png, 1709, 148, industry , whose profits had risen by up to 400 
Lines/a01/a01-117/a01-117-09.png, 1227, 165, per cent. in the last eight years .

Lines/l03/l03-008/l03-008-02.png, 1966, 117, way . Kennan pulled the manacle chain 
Lines/l03/l03-008/l03-008-03.png, 1867, 110, taut , and blasted two shots at the 
Lines/l03/l03-008/l03-008-04.png, 1929, 119, link which tied him to the ring-bolt in 
Lines/l03/l03-008/l03-008-05.png, 2037, 87, the rock . The nine-millimetre bullets sma- 
Lines/l03/l03-008/l03-008-06.png, 2052, 123, shed the chain as if it had been plastic , 
Lines/l03/l03-008/l03-008-07.png, 2053, 154, and , free , though the chain still dangled , 
Lines/l03/l03-008/l03-008-08.png, 1798, 109, he threw himself across the floor 
Lines/l03/l03-008/l03-008-09.png, 1127, 88, towards the entrance .

Lines/l03/l03-000/l03-000-02.png, 1623, 140, Malone was discovering the truth in 
Lines/l03/l03-000/l03-000-03.png, 1586, 162, scientific detail . Kennan had only 
Lines/l03/l03-000/l03-000-04.png, 1694, 285, seconds left . He jumped forward to 
Lines/l03/l03-000/l03-000-05.png, 1707, 176, the far limit of his chain , his 
Lines/l03/l03-000/l03-000-06.png, 1805, 214, right hand chopping edge-downwards 
Lines/l03/l03-000/l03-000-07.png, 1074, 198, in bone-jarring force . 
Lines/l03/l03-004/l03-004-00.png, 1686, 144, The blow took the writhing thug a fraction 
Lines/l03/l03-004/l03-004-01.png, 1827, 139, above the boney knob which landmarked the cervical 
Lines/l03/l03-004/l03-004-02.png, 1703, 178, plexus , the vital nerve-centre which a long-ago 
Lines/l03/l03-004/l03-004-03.png, 1807, 144, Marine instructor had declared the pinnacle of unarmed 
Lines/l03/l03-004/l03-004-04.png, 1749, 177, combat targets . The thug collapsed with a whistling 
Lines/l03/l03-004/l03-004-05.png, 1727, 183, moan , and Kennan tore the Luger from the man's 
Lines/l03/l03-004/l03-004-06.png, 1646, 175, suddenly limp hand . There was no time for 
Lines/l03/l03-004/l03-004-07.png, 1617, 191, rejoicing , but the hard , firm shape of the 
Lines/l03/l03-004/l03-004-08.png, 1800, 233, automatic sent a new confidence surging through 
Lines/l03/l03-004/l03-004-09.png, 297, 202, his body . 
Lines/f03/f03-191/f03-191-00.png, 1588, 145, May I suggest that you have proved that 
Lines/f03/f03-191/f03-191-01.png, 1840, 137, right ! Congratulations ! And away you go into 
Lines/f03/f03-191/f03-191-02.png, 1991, 138, your speech . Take some thought , too , for your ending . 
Lines/f03/f03-191/f03-191-03.png, 1896, 150, Thank you for listening to me so patiently . A political 
Lines/f03/f03-191/f03-191-04.png, 1866, 148, candidate often used that finish . No wonder he 
Lines/f03/f03-191/f03-191-05.png, 1720, 148, didn't get in ! Instead he might have ended 
Lines/f03/f03-191/f03-191-06.png, 1307, 153, this way : Well , those are my views . 
Lines/f03/f03-182/f03-182-00.png, 1789, 131, But that 's a terrible way to begin ! Why tell them you 
Lines/f03/f03-182/f03-182-01.png, 1695, 97, are a novice ? It 's their interest you want - not their 
Lines/f03/f03-182/f03-182-02.png, 1600, 106, sympathy . And you want to get it from the word 
Lines/f03/f03-182/f03-182-03.png, 1722, 114, GO ! Try something like this : It is said that tele- 
Lines/f03/f03-182/f03-182-04.png, 1669, 114, vision keeps people at home . But you , at any 
Lines/f03/f03-182/f03-182-05.png, 1746, 121, rate , have proved that wrong . And they say , too , 
Lines/f03/f03-182/f03-182-06.png, 1712, 107, that television makes its appeal to those of lesser 
Lines/f03/f03-182/f03-182-07.png, 394, 115, intelligence . 
Lines/f03/f03-174/f03-174-00.png, 1844, 160, So - see the next page ! Yes , they are waiting for you . 
Lines/f03/f03-174/f03-174-01.png, 1771, 135, But there is no need to be frightened . The audience 
Lines/f03/f03-174/f03-174-02.png, 1721, 126, will eat out of your hand - if they like what 
Lines/f03/f03-174/f03-174-03.png, 1727, 144, you offer them . A good start will put them in a 
Lines/f03/f03-174/f03-174-04.png, 1886, 145, good humour . Ladies and gentlemen ! I 'm afraid 
Lines/f03/f03-174/f03-174-05.png, 1796, 141, I have not had much experience of public speaking . 
Lines/f03/f03-169/f03-169-00.png, 1710, 160, Each time you rehearse you will probably put 
Lines/f03/f03-169/f03-169-01.png, 1683, 158, things in a different way . All the better ! - it will 
Lines/f03/f03-169/f03-169-02.png, 1650, 136, sound much more spontaneous on the occasion 
Lines/f03/f03-169/f03-169-03.png, 1633, 148, itself . Remember your four names - have the list 
Lines/f03/f03-169/f03-169-04.png, 1713, 163, with you if you like - and you simply can't 
Lines/f03/f03-169/f03-169-05.png, 1739, 145, be flummoxed ! Of course , in any speech a good 
Lines/f03/f03-169/f03-169-06.png, 1625, 133, start and a good finish are half the battle . 
Lines/h02/h02-035/h02-035-00.png, 1864, 82, The main tasks of the Rolleston Committee , whose advice 
Lines/h02/h02-035/h02-035-01.png, 1638, 75, we were invited to review , were to advise on : ( a ) the 
Lines/h02/h02-035/h02-035-02.png, 1756, 95, circumstances , if any , in which the supply of morphine 
Lines/h02/h02-035/h02-035-03.png, 1884, 101, and heroin , and preparations containing these substances , 
Lines/h02/h02-035/h02-035-04.png, 1884, 94, to persons addicted to those drugs might be regarded 
Lines/h02/h02-035/h02-035-05.png, 1905, 105, as medically advisable ; ( b ) the precautions which medical 
Lines/h02/h02-035/h02-035-06.png, 1865, 120, practitioners administering or prescribing morphine or 
Lines/h02/h02-035/h02-035-07.png, 1610, 115, heroin should adopt to avoid abuse and any 
Lines/h02/h02-035/h02-035-08.png, 1813, 87, administrative measures that seemed expedient to 
Lines/h02/h02-035/h02-035-09.png, 1535, 81, secure observance of those precautions . 
Lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-00.png, 1753, 82, 4 . On examination of the evidence it became clear 
Lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-01.png, 1851, 92, to us that carbromal and bromvaletone were examples 
Lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-02.png, 1821, 112, of a number of drugs on sale to the public which 
Lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-03.png, 1675, 133, were not appropriate for restriction to supply on 
Lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-04.png, 1801, 142, prescription under the Dangerous Drugs Act , 1951 , 
Lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-05.png, 1811, 126, or the Therapeutic Substances Act , 1956 , and had 
Lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-06.png, 1659, 114, not so far been recommended for control as 
Lines/h02/h02-017/h02-017-07.png, 256, 72, poisons . 
Lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-00.png, 1658, 181, 12 . Through the system of records and 
Lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-01.png, 1668, 117, inspection then in operation cases were 
Lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-02.png, 1791, 190, brought to the notice of the Home Office 
Lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-03.png, 1664, 142, at that time in which exceptionally 
Lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-04.png, 1764, 199, large quantities of morphine and heroin 
Lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-05.png, 1775, 145, had been supplied to particular practi- 
Lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-06.png, 1743, 165, tioners or prescribed for individual 
Lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-07.png, 1537, 168, cases . On further enquiry it was 
Lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-08.png, 1514, 106, ascertained that sometimes the 
Lines/h02/h02-037/h02-037-09.png, 1821, 148, doctor had ordered these drugs simply 
Lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-00.png, 1673, 77, 8 . The second part of our Interim Report was 
Lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-01.png, 1744, 60, devoted to anaesthetists who become addicted 
Lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-02.png, 1720, 72, to the gases and vapours which they use in the 
Lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-03.png, 1528, 78, course of their professional duties . We 
Lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-04.png, 1809, 78, ascertained that the incidence of this irregular- 
Lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-05.png, 1680, 85, ity was very small indeed . However , over a 
Lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-06.png, 1844, 83, period of eleven years , patients' lives had been 
Lines/h02/h02-024/h02-024-07.png, 1386, 89, endangered in two known instances . 
Lines/h02/h02-008/h02-008-00.png, 1960, 171, As a general rule we did not ask for oral evidence , though 
Lines/h02/h02-008/h02-008-01.png, 1874, 188, we found it an advantage in certain instances . Appendix 
Lines/h02/h02-008/h02-008-02.png, 1745, 145, 1 gives a list of the bodies and persons consulted . The 
Lines/h02/h02-008/h02-008-03.png, 1851, 188, Department of Health for Scotland , the Home Office and 
Lines/h02/h02-008/h02-008-04.png, 1749, 166, the Ministry of Health submitted evidence to us ; 
Lines/h02/h02-008/h02-008-05.png, 1876, 167, officers of these Departments attended our meetings 
Lines/h02/h02-008/h02-008-06.png, 1608, 162, and have given us valuable assistance . 
Lines/h02/h02-022/h02-022-00.png, 1725, 100, We are glad to note the action that has been taken 
Lines/h02/h02-022/h02-022-01.png, 1730, 95, and we hope that arrangements will be made to ensure 
Lines/h02/h02-022/h02-022-02.png, 1718, 104, that , as other preparations affecting the central nervous 
Lines/h02/h02-022/h02-022-03.png, 1680, 99, system become available , they too will be brought to 
Lines/h02/h02-022/h02-022-04.png, 1846, 99, the notice of the Poisons Board , or such other advisory 
Lines/h02/h02-022/h02-022-05.png, 1660, 89, body as may in due course be appointed for the 
Lines/h02/h02-022/h02-022-06.png, 1757, 81, purpose , to consider whether there are sufficient 
Lines/h02/h02-022/h02-022-07.png, 1734, 105, grounds for restricting any of them also to supply 
Lines/h02/h02-022/h02-022-08.png, 568, 81, on prescription . 
Lines/h02/h02-019/h02-019-00.png, 1733, 123, 5 . We recommended that , in general , any drug or 
Lines/h02/h02-019/h02-019-01.png, 1883, 141, pharmaceutical preparation which has an action on the 
Lines/h02/h02-019/h02-019-02.png, 1951, 114, central nervous system and is liable to produce physical 
Lines/h02/h02-019/h02-019-03.png, 2014, 138, or psychological deterioration should be confined to supply 
Lines/h02/h02-019/h02-019-04.png, 1856, 149, on prescription and that an independent expert body 
Lines/h02/h02-019/h02-019-05.png, 1862, 139, should be responsible for advising which substances

Lines/h02/h02-019/h02-019-07.png, 2022, 116, measure , the Secretary of State for the Home Department , 
Lines/h02/h02-019/h02-019-08.png, 1860, 116, on the recommendation of the Poisons Board , has 
Lines/h02/h02-040/h02-040-00.png, 2121, 117, 13 . It appeared then that in some circumstances 
Lines/h02/h02-040/h02-040-01.png, 1859, 134, dangerous drugs were being supplied in 
Lines/h02/h02-040/h02-040-02.png, 2071, 111, contravention of the intention of Parliament 
Lines/h02/h02-040/h02-040-03.png, 2083, 106, that a doctor should be authorised to supply 
Lines/h02/h02-040/h02-040-04.png, 2072, 129, drugs only so far as was necessary for the 
Lines/h02/h02-040/h02-040-05.png, 2016, 144, practice of his profession . Before deciding on 
Lines/h02/h02-040/h02-040-06.png, 2003, 110, measures to secure proper observance of 
Lines/h02/h02-040/h02-040-07.png, 2154, 112, the law , it was felt necessary to have 
Lines/h02/h02-040/h02-040-08.png, 2131, 95, some authoritative medical advice on various 
Lines/h02/h02-040/h02-040-09.png, 1901, 140, aspects of the treatment of addiction , ...

Lines/h02/h02-043/h02-043-03.png, 1932, 93, on the use of drugs in treatment are discussed 
Lines/h02/h02-043/h02-043-04.png, 1920, 94, later in this Report . They have , up to now , 
Lines/h02/h02-043/h02-043-05.png, 1901, 76, been included in the Memorandum on 
Lines/h02/h02-043/h02-043-06.png, 1864, 106, the Dangerous Drugs Act and Regulations 
Lines/h02/h02-043/h02-043-07.png, 1794, 121, which is prepared by the Home Office 
Lines/h02/h02-043/h02-043-08.png, 1764, 109, for the information of doctors and 
Lines/h02/h02-043/h02-043-09.png, 369, 68, dentists . 
Lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-00.png, 1713, 87, We were assured by our expert witnesses on this 
Lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-01.png, 1859, 99, subject that , with the apparatus at present to hand , the 
Lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-02.png, 1770, 105, preliminary sniffing of the gases immediately before 
Lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-03.png, 1865, 94, administering them to a patient was a recognised and 
Lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-04.png, 1858, 80, necessary precaution . We accepted this . 10 . In view of 
Lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-05.png, 1824, 99, the heavy and direct responsibility carried by every 
Lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-06.png, 1809, 81, anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted 
Lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-07.png, 1885, 97, to the inhalation of gases and vapours should never be 
Lines/h02/h02-028/h02-028-08.png, 1250, 68, entrusted with their administration . 
Lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-00.png, 1789, 96, We have held eleven meetings . We decided as a 
Lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-01.png, 1769, 110, first step to seek information from a number 
Lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-02.png, 1816, 142, of organisations and persons having an interest 
Lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-03.png, 1835, 155, in the questions before us and at a later stage we 
Lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-04.png, 1671, 146, arranged for publication of a press notice inviting 
Lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-05.png, 1714, 132, anybody interested to submit representations . We 
Lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-06.png, 1719, 136, compiled a list of the points which we thought 
Lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-07.png, 1749, 145, were of importance , but we made it clear that 
Lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-08.png, 1536, 140, the replies need not be confined to these 
Lines/h02/h02-004/h02-004-09.png, 615, 125, particular items . 
Lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-00.png, 1802, 92, On 23rd November , 1959 , we submitted 
Lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-01.png, 1879, 113, an Interim Report . This dealt with two questions 
Lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-02.png, 1835, 121, which arose from our terms of reference and 
Lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-03.png, 1913, 174, which had been brought specially to our notice . 
Lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-04.png, 1848, 98, First , we were asked to examine the risks 
Lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-05.png, 1611, 138, attending the abuse of carbromal and 
Lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-06.png, 1878, 164, bromvaletone and preparations containing these 
Lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-07.png, 1808, 163, substances . The Poisons Board had already 
Lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-08.png, 1896, 149, considered this problem but , in the absence of 
Lines/h02/h02-012/h02-012-09.png, 1884, 126, sufficient evidence that these compounds 
Lines/h02/h02-049/h02-049-00.png, 1695, 98, The Secretary of State was empowered , on the recommendation of a 
Lines/h02/h02-049/h02-049-01.png, 1745, 94, tribunal , to withdraw a doctor's authority to possess and supply 
Lines/h02/h02-049/h02-049-02.png, 1802, 90, dangerous drugs and to direct that such a doctor , or a doctor 
Lines/h02/h02-049/h02-049-03.png, 1759, 85, convicted of an offence under the Act , should not issue 
Lines/h02/h02-049/h02-049-04.png, 1710, 98, prescriptions for dangerous drugs . ( 3 ) It was made clear 
Lines/h02/h02-049/h02-049-05.png, 1793, 112, that prescriptions should only be given by a duly qualified 
Lines/h02/h02-049/h02-049-06.png, 1562, 113, medical practitioner when required for purposes of 
Lines/h02/h02-049/h02-049-07.png, 548, 62, medical treatment . 
Lines/r06/r06-027/r06-027-00.png, 1654, 132, There they were , in fact , below us , eight of them . 
Lines/r06/r06-027/r06-027-01.png, 1702, 114, Four of them were flattened on the window sills , two 
Lines/r06/r06-027/r06-027-02.png, 1733, 107, immolated on a nearby roof top , the other pair copulating . 
Lines/r06/r06-027/r06-027-03.png, 1603, 99, We had a morning at Pierre's . He talked about people . 
Lines/r06/r06-027/r06-027-04.png, 1837, 111, Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named 
Lines/r06/r06-027/r06-027-05.png, 1779, 123, Lawrence . He was here , near the railway station , three or 
Lines/r06/r06-027/r06-027-06.png, 1517, 109, four years . During this period he wrote a book , 
Lines/r06/r06-027/r06-027-07.png, 883, 116, The Lover of Lady Chatterly . 
Lines/r06/r06-121/r06-121-00.png, 1788, 130, At the school , which is charming , ci- 
Lines/r06/r06-121/r06-121-01.png, 1850, 97, vilised and expensive , the two children 
Lines/r06/r06-121/r06-121-02.png, 1837, 119, walked together across green fields , and 
Lines/r06/r06-121/r06-121-03.png, 1764, 123, I followed , seeing how the sun gilded 
Lines/r06/r06-121/r06-121-04.png, 1642, 138, their bright friendly heads turned 
Lines/r06/r06-121/r06-121-05.png, 1734, 128, towards each other as they talked . In 
Lines/r06/r06-121/r06-121-06.png, 1741, 94, Catherine's left hand she carried the 
Lines/r06/r06-121/r06-121-07.png, 1751, 92, stories of Isaac Babel . After lunch we 
Lines/r06/r06-121/r06-121-08.png, 1692, 107, went to the pictures . Philip allowed 
Lines/r06/r06-121/r06-121-09.png, 1754, 126, # it to be seen that he thought going to 
Lines/r06/r06-121/r06-121-10.png, 1769, 117, the pictures just for the fun of it was 
Lines/r06/r06-103/r06-103-00.png, 1860, 118, The sister , able to swim , had returned 
Lines/r06/r06-103/r06-103-01.png, 1802, 140, to the shore , but instead of returning 
Lines/r06/r06-103/r06-103-02.png, 1699, 95, to her brother-in-law ( with whom 
Lines/r06/r06-103/r06-103-03.png, 1709, 105, she had an illicit relationship ) , she 
Lines/r06/r06-103/r06-103-04.png, 1798, 101, went to her fiance*?2's house and 
Lines/r06/r06-103/r06-103-05.png, 1601, 137, confessed everything . Her fiance*?2 
Lines/r06/r06-103/r06-103-06.png, 1898, 100, reported her to the police , and then jumped 
Lines/r06/r06-103/r06-103-07.png, 1328, 98, off a cliff near Monte Carlo . 
Lines/r06/r06-106/r06-106-00.png, 1650, 141, The day I promised to take Catherine 
Lines/r06/r06-106/r06-106-01.png, 1718, 136, down to visit my young friend Philip 
Lines/r06/r06-106/r06-106-02.png, 1809, 130, at his school in the country , we were 
Lines/r06/r06-106/r06-106-03.png, 1713, 92, to leave at eleven , but she arrived 
Lines/r06/r06-106/r06-106-04.png, 1720, 99, at nine . Her blue dress was new , 
Lines/r06/r06-106/r06-106-05.png, 1844, 85, and so were her fashionable shoes . Her 
Lines/r06/r06-106/r06-106-06.png, 1769, 102, hair had just been done . She looked 
Lines/r06/r06-106/r06-106-07.png, 1772, 122, more than ever like a pink and gold 
Lines/r06/r06-106/r06-106-08.png, 1816, 132, Renoir girl who expects everything from 
Lines/r06/r06-106/r06-106-09.png, 174, 94, life . 
Lines/r06/r06-035/r06-035-00.png, 1690, 104, No , he hadn't read it ; Madame did all the 
Lines/r06/r06-035/r06-035-01.png, 1775, 169, reading . Lawrence died in this very place . 
Lines/r06/r06-035/r06-035-02.png, 1711, 164, He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and 
Lines/r06/r06-035/r06-035-03.png, 1651, 155, again . No , he couldn't really remember 
Lines/r06/r06-035/r06-035-04.png, 1671, 120, him , he was one of the crowd . The 
Lines/r06/r06-035/r06-035-05.png, 1619, 161, sun came out ; Mart went shopping ; I 
Lines/r06/r06-035/r06-035-06.png, 1640, 172, sat in the square reading the Patriote . 
Lines/r06/r06-062/r06-062-00.png, 1782, 146, There is a curd of morning smoke and 
Lines/r06/r06-062/r06-062-01.png, 1712, 145, a muffled bell taps the sky . Here we 
Lines/r06/r06-062/r06-062-02.png, 1737, 172, stopped , as in fine weather we always 
Lines/r06/r06-062/r06-062-03.png, 1805, 167, stopped . Down below is the village of 
Lines/r06/r06-062/r06-062-04.png, 1636, 201, Cagnes , but between are pockets of 
Lines/r06/r06-062/r06-062-05.png, 1657, 112, heat and cold like the hands of 
Lines/r06/r06-062/r06-062-06.png, 1721, 181, friends or strangers , and a flurry of 
Lines/r06/r06-062/r06-062-07.png, 1664, 177, early smells , the dark bosoms of 
Lines/r06/r06-062/r06-062-08.png, 1531, 177, beech and the thin pine fingers 
Lines/r06/r06-062/r06-062-09.png, 856, 174, kissed by the sun . 
Lines/r06/r06-022/r06-022-00.png, 1731, 109, This was strange , even magic , because the owner's 
Lines/r06/r06-022/r06-022-01.png, 1764, 92, name was Pierre Tortorolo which , in Nicoison Italian means 
Lines/r06/r06-022/r06-022-02.png, 1691, 109, ' turtledove ' . Pierre Turtledove . When we woke up properly it 
Lines/r06/r06-022/r06-022-03.png, 1789, 95, was raining , an even more hopeless rain than London , and we 
Lines/r06/r06-022/r06-022-04.png, 1725, 124, looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the 
Lines/r06/r06-022/r06-022-05.png, 1806, 91, curling white breath of the mountains . The land looked 
Lines/r06/r06-022/r06-022-06.png, 1715, 101, like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her 
Lines/r06/r06-022/r06-022-07.png, 198, 61, shame . 
Lines/r06/r06-003/r06-003-00.png, 1800, 101, One called La Patriote is Communist , and at the time 
Lines/r06/r06-003/r06-003-01.png, 1799, 130, of our arrival it was throwing huge over-ripe verbal 
Lines/r06/r06-003/r06-003-02.png, 1744, 116, tomatoes at General de Gaulle . One side of this square 
Lines/r06/r06-003/r06-003-03.png, 1835, 77, is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's Bar . For one 
Lines/r06/r06-003/r06-003-04.png, 1863, 92, day , with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative , we had been 
Lines/r06/r06-003/r06-003-05.png, 1690, 101, hunting for furnished rooms , and had given up , when an 
Lines/r06/r06-003/r06-003-06.png, 1848, 104, elderly lady , the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest , 
Lines/r06/r06-003/r06-003-07.png, 1360, 97, had firmly closed the door in our noses . 
Lines/r06/r06-057/r06-057-00.png, 1819, 97, We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta . 
Lines/r06/r06-057/r06-057-01.png, 1813, 177, You can free-wheel down a quarter of the 
Lines/r06/r06-057/r06-057-02.png, 1732, 165, way . In the middle of the journey is a 
Lines/r06/r06-057/r06-057-03.png, 1676, 119, valley with a sea of vines and olives 
Lines/r06/r06-057/r06-057-04.png, 1784, 152, and beaches of earth pricked to blood by 
Lines/r06/r06-057/r06-057-05.png, 1715, 167, the hoe . Rising from the flecked sea are 
Lines/r06/r06-057/r06-057-06.png, 1713, 182, islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and 
Lines/r06/r06-057/r06-057-07.png, 1740, 214, towns , grey , rose-headed mariners clinging 
Lines/r06/r06-057/r06-057-08.png, 1084, 150, like limpets to the rock . 
Lines/r06/r06-076/r06-076-00.png, 1698, 130, They all had that neat look of 
Lines/r06/r06-076/r06-076-01.png, 1695, 188, Mediterranean people to whom nothing 
Lines/r06/r06-076/r06-076-02.png, 1741, 130, could ever happen , the chosen sane , the 
Lines/r06/r06-076/r06-076-03.png, 1530, 127, uncuckolded , unrobbed , sheltered from 
Lines/r06/r06-076/r06-076-04.png, 1821, 173, disease and accident by doctors , God and 
Lines/r06/r06-076/r06-076-05.png, 1843, 163, the municipality . Yet , at any time now , 
Lines/r06/r06-076/r06-076-06.png, 1885, 151, the bell would ring for them - the gilded 
Lines/r06/r06-076/r06-076-07.png, 1750, 148, love house , the mad grandmother or the 
Lines/r06/r06-076/r06-076-08.png, 1385, 138, bloody child at the crossroads . 
Lines/r06/r06-097/r06-097-00.png, 1742, 117, We went straight to bed and slept until 
Lines/r06/r06-097/r06-097-01.png, 1770, 101, the turtle-doves drummed up the 
Lines/r06/r06-097/r06-097-02.png, 1894, 129, sun . The next morning , in the square 
Lines/r06/r06-097/r06-097-03.png, 1858, 108, opposite Pierre's , I read about the Nice 
Lines/r06/r06-097/r06-097-04.png, 1603, 95, beach catastrophe in the Patriote . 
Lines/r06/r06-097/r06-097-05.png, 1848, 147, Mart had been right , the body had been 
Lines/r06/r06-097/r06-097-06.png, 1816, 144, a woman's . It belonged to a Madame 
Lines/r06/r06-097/r06-097-07.png, 1703, 120, N. Enquiries had been made in the 
Lines/r06/r06-097/r06-097-08.png, 1703, 115, neighbourhood , and it transpired that 
Lines/r06/r06-097/r06-097-09.png, 1629, 75, Madame N's husband had made an 
Lines/r06/r06-097/r06-097-10.png, 1785, 123, arrangement with the dead lady's sister 
Lines/r06/r06-011/r06-011-00.png, 1589, 111, We went in . There were a few people in the bar , 
Lines/r06/r06-011/r06-011-01.png, 1800, 120, elderly , well-off , artistic , who , you felt , had made a hard 
Lines/r06/r06-011/r06-011-02.png, 1698, 131, bargain for giving up . ' I have furnished rooms , ' said

Lines/r06/r06-011/r06-011-04.png, 1654, 113, month . ' Yes , ' we said immediately , even before viewing . 
Lines/r06/r06-011/r06-011-05.png, 979, 104, We were shown around by Pierre . 
Lines/r06/r06-049/r06-049-00.png, 1472, 183, Monsieur V's house was immediately 
Lines/r06/r06-049/r06-049-01.png, 1681, 187, surrounded by firemen and other officials , 
Lines/r06/r06-049/r06-049-02.png, 1772, 118, but there was no Monsieur V. He telephoned 
Lines/r06/r06-049/r06-049-03.png, 1730, 167, a few minutes later from a nearby village , 
Lines/r06/r06-049/r06-049-04.png, 1763, 167, apologising for the trouble , but explaining 
Lines/r06/r06-049/r06-049-05.png, 1638, 145, that the walls were porous and the 
Lines/r06/r06-049/r06-049-06.png, 1571, 154, gas had escaped . General relief was 
Lines/r06/r06-049/r06-049-07.png, 1538, 119, expressed , but Monsieur V ( this was 
Lines/r06/r06-049/r06-049-08.png, 1859, 148, actually reported in the next issue ) returned 
Lines/r06/r06-049/r06-049-09.png, 1785, 211, home and shot himself , leaving a note 
Lines/r06/r06-049/r06-049-10.png, 1730, 194, which again left his household goods 
Lines/r06/r06-111/r06-111-00.png, 1628, 88, Catherine lives in a white house 
Lines/r06/r06-111/r06-111-01.png, 1739, 132, overlooking the sweeping brown tides 
Lines/r06/r06-111/r06-111-02.png, 1751, 134, of the river . She helped me clean up my 
Lines/r06/r06-111/r06-111-03.png, 1773, 100, flat with a devotion which said that 
Lines/r06/r06-111/r06-111-04.png, 1872, 128, she felt small flats were altogether more 
Lines/r06/r06-111/r06-111-05.png, 1765, 113, romantic than large houses . We drank 
Lines/r06/r06-111/r06-111-06.png, 1844, 129, tea , and talked mainly about Philip , who , 
Lines/r06/r06-111/r06-111-07.png, 1793, 117, being 15 , has pure stern tastes in every- 
Lines/r06/r06-111/r06-111-08.png, 1173, 131, thing from food to music . 
Lines/r06/r06-041/r06-041-00.png, 1655, 139, There was a front-page rear-attack on de 
Lines/r06/r06-041/r06-041-01.png, 1683, 266, Gaulle , and the rest of the paper was given up 
Lines/r06/r06-041/r06-041-02.png, 1596, 173, to murders , apart for an outcry against a 
Lines/r06/r06-041/r06-041-03.png, 1786, 142, proposal to drop radio-active material into 
Lines/r06/r06-041/r06-041-04.png, 1702, 101, the Mediterranean between Corsica and St 
Lines/r06/r06-041/r06-041-05.png, 1813, 137, Raphael . All the murders were well documented 
Lines/r06/r06-041/r06-041-06.png, 1571, 163, and had the air of being written by an 
Lines/r06/r06-041/r06-041-07.png, 1697, 169, ingenious , but mad film director of the 
Lines/r06/r06-041/r06-041-08.png, 320, 98, Thirties . 
Lines/r06/r06-053/r06-053-00.png, 1736, 193, Some grim comic relief was provided by 
Lines/r06/r06-053/r06-053-01.png, 1749, 183, an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot 
Lines/r06/r06-053/r06-053-02.png, 1789, 126, who hid himself in a bush and imitated 
Lines/r06/r06-053/r06-053-03.png, 1839, 179, a blackbird . Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver 
Lines/r06/r06-053/r06-053-04.png, 1788, 162, was after this very bird and shot the farm- 
Lines/r06/r06-053/r06-053-05.png, 1554, 145, labourer in the face . All , however , 
Lines/r06/r06-053/r06-053-06.png, 1596, 142, ended well , reported the paper , since the 
Lines/r06/r06-053/r06-053-07.png, 1522, 159, pellets were easily removed and the 
Lines/r06/r06-053/r06-053-08.png, 1711, 122, labourer was able to return to work the 
Lines/r06/r06-053/r06-053-09.png, 639, 111, same afternoon . 
Lines/r06/r06-007/r06-007-00.png, 1771, 113, ' It is a pity , ' said Mart , ' because it would have been 
Lines/r06/r06-007/r06-007-01.png, 1708, 103, a good address . ' Now , after a woman's radar look , 
Lines/r06/r06-007/r06-007-02.png, 1708, 103, she decided Pierre would solve our problems . This 
Lines/r06/r06-007/r06-007-03.png, 1686, 97, was true , Pierre was a true Provenc*?6al , thin and 
Lines/r06/r06-007/r06-007-04.png, 1677, 117, yellow as lemon peel , wrestling with some gnawing rat 
Lines/r06/r06-007/r06-007-05.png, 1826, 111, of an illness , man of all trades , married to a commanding

Lines/r06/r06-130/r06-130-00.png, 1754, 104, At the entrance of the cinema the 
Lines/r06/r06-130/r06-130-01.png, 1838, 137, doorman was lying in wait for anyone 
Lines/r06/r06-130/r06-130-02.png, 1804, 121, who had red eyes . Grasping Catherine 
Lines/r06/r06-130/r06-130-03.png, 1721, 127, by her suffering arm , he said bitterly : 
Lines/r06/r06-130/r06-130-04.png, 1693, 150, ' Yes , why are you crying , he had to be 
Lines/r06/r06-130/r06-130-05.png, 1838, 101, punished for his crime , didn't he ? ' Cathe- 
Lines/r06/r06-130/r06-130-06.png, 1739, 89, rine stared at him , incredulous . Philip 
Lines/r06/r06-130/r06-130-07.png, 1696, 120, rescued her by saying with disdain : 
Lines/r06/r06-130/r06-130-08.png, 1863, 139, ' Some people don't know right from wrong 
Lines/r06/r06-130/r06-130-09.png, 1730, 77, even when its demonstrated to them . ' 
Lines/r06/r06-126/r06-126-00.png, 1667, 89, For his sake we chose the more 
Lines/r06/r06-126/r06-126-01.png, 1687, 104, serious of the two films that were 
Lines/r06/r06-126/r06-126-02.png, 1676, 125, showing in the little town . It was 
Lines/r06/r06-126/r06-126-03.png, 1705, 135, about a good priest who helped cri- 
Lines/r06/r06-126/r06-126-04.png, 1753, 130, minals in New York . His goodness , how- 
Lines/r06/r06-126/r06-126-05.png, 1686, 117, ever , was not enough to prevent one 
Lines/r06/r06-126/r06-126-06.png, 1680, 140, of them from being sent to the gas 
Lines/r06/r06-126/r06-126-07.png, 1736, 103, chamber ; and Philip and I waited with 
Lines/r06/r06-126/r06-126-08.png, 1835, 97, Catherine in the dark until she had stopped 
Lines/r06/r06-126/r06-126-09.png, 1819, 131, crying and could face the light of a golden 
Lines/r06/r06-126/r06-126-10.png, 401, 104, evening . 
Lines/r06/r06-044/r06-044-00.png, 1639, 142, They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses . 
Lines/r06/r06-044/r06-044-01.png, 1775, 118, Monsieur H , for instance , had been clubbed and 
Lines/r06/r06-044/r06-044-02.png, 1818, 186, throttled to death by his wife , children and 
Lines/r06/r06-044/r06-044-03.png, 1685, 173, father-in-law , after muddling up some sheep 
Lines/r06/r06-044/r06-044-04.png, 1676, 181, while the worse for drink . The family 
Lines/r06/r06-044/r06-044-05.png, 1709, 170, group then sat down for a late lunch 
Lines/r06/r06-044/r06-044-06.png, 1798, 141, before the father-in-law telephoned the police . 
Lines/r06/r06-044/r06-044-07.png, 1737, 192, Then again , Monsieur V , owing to family 
Lines/r06/r06-044/r06-044-08.png, 1496, 101, troubles , had written to the local 
Lines/r06/r06-044/r06-044-09.png, 1759, 158, paper and the superintendent of police , 
Lines/r06/r06-044/r06-044-10.png, 1768, 143, informing them that he was on the point 
Lines/r06/r06-137/r06-137-00.png, 1709, 84, The doorman turned his attention 
Lines/r06/r06-137/r06-137-01.png, 1869, 131, to the next red-eyed emerger from the 
Lines/r06/r06-137/r06-137-02.png, 1720, 121, dark ; and we went on together to 
Lines/r06/r06-137/r06-137-03.png, 1812, 108, the station , the children silent because 
Lines/r06/r06-137/r06-137-04.png, 1910, 128, of the cruelty of the world . Finally Catherine 
Lines/r06/r06-137/r06-137-05.png, 1840, 117, said , her eyes wet again : ' I think its all 
Lines/r06/r06-137/r06-137-06.png, 1876, 126, absolutely beastly , and I can't bear to think 
Lines/r06/r06-137/r06-137-07.png, 1869, 124, about it . ' And Philip said : ' But we 've got 
Lines/r06/r06-137/r06-137-08.png, 1790, 134, to think about it , don't you see , because 
Lines/r06/r06-137/r06-137-09.png, 1783, 116, if we don't it 'll just go on and on , don't 
Lines/r06/r06-137/r06-137-10.png, 400, 117, you see ? ' 
Lines/r06/r06-090/r06-090-00.png, 1653, 141, It was growing cold . We left the 
Lines/r06/r06-090/r06-090-01.png, 1695, 81, crowd and drove back to Vence . 
Lines/r06/r06-090/r06-090-02.png, 1711, 144, The cool evening perfumes stood 
Lines/r06/r06-090/r06-090-03.png, 1828, 138, beckoning at the corners of the roads . 
Lines/r06/r06-090/r06-090-04.png, 1687, 84, Mart is unable to smell ( her sense 
Lines/r06/r06-090/r06-090-05.png, 1884, 122, organs were impaired years ago ) , and 
Lines/r06/r06-090/r06-090-06.png, 1703, 110, I had to explain the low , sharp and 
Lines/r06/r06-090/r06-090-07.png, 1747, 128, sweet signals in the air . When we 
Lines/r06/r06-090/r06-090-08.png, 1723, 133, got back home we felt exhausted . 
Lines/r06/r06-090/r06-090-09.png, 1732, 134, London sickness ( a sense of guilt , 
Lines/r06/r06-090/r06-090-10.png, 1824, 126, mingled with the memory of sandwiches 
Lines/r06/r06-018/r06-018-00.png, 1802, 122, The flat was on the third floor ; two rooms ; soft Provenc*? 
Lines/r06/r06-018/r06-018-01.png, 1762, 123, 6al view ; good intimate furnishing and colour ; running

Lines/r06/r06-018/r06-018-03.png, 1608, 96, basin and bidet ; own private , modern lavatory . The 
Lines/r06/r06-018/r06-018-04.png, 1742, 117, first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence . 
Lines/r06/r06-018/r06-018-05.png, 1637, 101, We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft 
Lines/r06/r06-018/r06-018-06.png, 850, 90, eruption of turtle-doves . 
Lines/r06/r06-143/r06-143-00.png, 1447, 115, In the train going back to London I sat 
Lines/r06/r06-143/r06-143-01.png, 1692, 139, beside # Catherine . She had the stories open 
Lines/r06/r06-143/r06-143-02.png, 1873, 123, in front of her , but she said : ' Philip 's awfully lucky . 
Lines/r06/r06-143/r06-143-03.png, 1577, 104, I wish I went to that school . Did you notice 
Lines/r06/r06-143/r06-143-04.png, 1581, 130, that girl who said hullo to him in the garden ? 
Lines/r06/r06-070/r06-070-00.png, 1743, 138, We parked the Lambretta opposite the 
Lines/r06/r06-070/r06-070-01.png, 1633, 157, Negresco , and went to the beach to 
Lines/r06/r06-070/r06-070-02.png, 1828, 182, have a swim . Amazing bedlam rocked 
Lines/r06/r06-070/r06-070-03.png, 1887, 191, in our eyes . The sea boiled with waves , 
Lines/r06/r06-070/r06-070-04.png, 1711, 163, they galloped to the walls and spumed 
Lines/r06/r06-070/r06-070-05.png, 1829, 189, over the Promenade des Anglais . A huge 
Lines/r06/r06-070/r06-070-06.png, 1768, 135, crowd had collected . There were firemen 
Lines/r06/r06-070/r06-070-07.png, 1849, 137, and policemen and ambulances , and the 
Lines/r06/r06-070/r06-070-08.png, 1689, 162, eyes of the spectators were hard with 
Lines/r06/r06-070/r06-070-09.png, 283, 100, disaster . 
Lines/r06/r06-066/r06-066-00.png, 1808, 168, Then here was Nice , and the old holiday 
Lines/r06/r06-066/r06-066-01.png, 1636, 131, sea , blue as a new school exercise 
Lines/r06/r06-066/r06-066-02.png, 1683, 149, book . The same old Nice , creamy , 
Lines/r06/r06-066/r06-066-03.png, 1688, 159, vulgar , out of time , bitter-sweet with 
Lines/r06/r06-066/r06-066-04.png, 1860, 173, the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant 
Lines/r06/r06-066/r06-066-05.png, 1820, 210, prostitutes , edging past grubby grandeur 
Lines/r06/r06-066/r06-066-06.png, 1819, 155, to the old sleeping port . This , and 
Lines/r06/r06-066/r06-066-07.png, 1750, 224, Paris , were my ruined pavilions , and I 
Lines/r06/r06-066/r06-066-08.png, 1787, 101, could catch the taste of dead dreams on 
Lines/r06/r06-066/r06-066-09.png, 1002, 173, my tongue like spray . 
Lines/r06/r06-000/r06-000-00.png, 1538, 115, Vence is a sober spot , half way between small 
Lines/r06/r06-000/r06-000-01.png, 1685, 130, town and village , pigeon grey , sly with arches , and 
Lines/r06/r06-000/r06-000-02.png, 1615, 133, linked by a whispering plot of fountains . In the main 
Lines/r06/r06-000/r06-000-03.png, 1537, 113, tree-heavy square you can sit in the autumn 
Lines/r06/r06-000/r06-000-04.png, 1634, 129, sunshine , still burning like a half-cooled iron , 
Lines/r06/r06-000/r06-000-05.png, 1367, 117, sip pastis and read the local newspapers . 
Lines/r06/r06-115/r06-115-00.png, 1741, 143, Catherine looked at the books lying 
Lines/r06/r06-115/r06-115-01.png, 1698, 83, around his room , and asked if she 
Lines/r06/r06-115/r06-115-02.png, 1780, 113, might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel 
Lines/r06/r06-115/r06-115-03.png, 1753, 76, to read on the train . Catherine is 13 . 
Lines/r06/r06-115/r06-115-04.png, 1743, 143, I suggested she might find them dif- 
Lines/r06/r06-115/r06-115-05.png, 1849, 107, ficult , but she said , ' Philip reads them , 
Lines/r06/r06-115/r06-115-06.png, 1715, 147, doesn't he ? ' During the journey I read 
Lines/r06/r06-115/r06-115-07.png, 1642, 120, newspapers and watched her pretty 
Lines/r06/r06-115/r06-115-08.png, 1582, 149, frowning face as she turned the 
Lines/r06/r06-115/r06-115-09.png, 1793, 115, pages of Babel , for she was determined 
Lines/r06/r06-115/r06-115-10.png, 1738, 145, to let nothing get between her and 
Lines/p01/p01-168/p01-168-00.png, 1747, 97, He didn't know what to make of it , but it 
Lines/p01/p01-168/p01-168-01.png, 1812, 99, was Mr. Copthorne all right . Perhaps he had 
Lines/p01/p01-168/p01-168-02.png, 1704, 128, been attending some kind of fancy dress do 
Lines/p01/p01-168/p01-168-03.png, 1745, 139, in London . Very strange his eyes looked . Mad , 
Lines/p01/p01-168/p01-168-04.png, 1692, 136, hunted eyes , as if the poor fellow had rocks in 
Lines/p01/p01-168/p01-168-05.png, 1616, 114, his head , so the verger described afterwards . 
Lines/p01/p01-168/p01-168-06.png, 1705, 145, " You 're very early about , sir , " he said , trying to 
Lines/p01/p01-168/p01-168-07.png, 514, 100, speak normally . 
Lines/p01/p01-147/p01-147-00.png, 1798, 118, Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side

Lines/c02/c02-035/c02-035-00.png, 1792, 87, It is most unfair to call " Malachias " a cut-rate 
Lines/c02/c02-035/c02-035-01.png, 1814, 102, " Dolce Vita , " for it is far more intimate and deeply 
Lines/c02/c02-035/c02-035-02.png, 1789, 107, felt . In 1944 Herbert Selpin tried a similar feat 
Lines/c02/c02-035/c02-035-03.png, 1677, 114, in " Titanic " by paralleling the last days of the 
Lines/c02/c02-035/c02-035-04.png, 1853, 112, Third Reich with the sinking of the great ocean liner , 
Lines/c02/c02-035/c02-035-05.png, 1579, 100, and paid for his audacity with his life . 
Lines/c02/c02-007/c02-007-00.png, 1655, 106, In 1950 he began to take photographs not 
Lines/c02/c02-007/c02-007-01.png, 1610, 134, only in Germany but also in Africa and 
Lines/c02/c02-007/c02-007-02.png, 1760, 82, America . An exhibition of these works which 
Lines/c02/c02-007/c02-007-03.png, 1767, 114, is now on view in a Berlin gallery is most im- 
Lines/c02/c02-007/c02-007-04.png, 1796, 113, pressive . As Friedrich Du"rrenmatt , the Swiss 
Lines/c02/c02-007/c02-007-05.png, 1774, 107, playwright and author , wrote : " Wicki's blacks

Lines/c02/c02-007/c02-007-07.png, 1769, 148, lost and the forgotten , but they are also the 
Lines/c02/c02-007/c02-007-08.png, 1384, 96, technical means of abstraction . 
Lines/c02/c02-056/c02-056-00.png, 1678, 132, This director is at last being re-evaluated and 
Lines/c02/c02-056/c02-056-01.png, 1716, 127, given his proper place in the history of the 
Lines/c02/c02-056/c02-056-02.png, 1899, 131, German film . Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek 
Lines/c02/c02-056/c02-056-03.png, 1763, 137, " Unheimliche Geschichten " ( 1920 ) , five ghost stories 
Lines/c02/c02-056/c02-056-04.png, 1895, 126, with a light touch , and there was much to admire 
Lines/c02/c02-056/c02-056-05.png, 1780, 114, in " Dreyfus " ( 1930 ) and the virtually unknown 
Lines/c02/c02-056/c02-056-06.png, 1759, 109, but extremely important " 1914 " ( 1931 ) , which 
Lines/c02/c02-056/c02-056-07.png, 1678, 124, tries to show that it took more than just 
Lines/c02/c02-056/c02-056-08.png, 1481, 133, Germany to start the First World War . 
Lines/c02/c02-003/c02-003-00.png, 1812, 65, It would now seem that Wicki's name must 
Lines/c02/c02-003/c02-003-01.png, 1762, 110, be added to this list , for his new film 
Lines/c02/c02-003/c02-003-02.png, 1883, 94, may well be a landmark in the revitali- 
Lines/c02/c02-003/c02-003-03.png, 1752, 99, sation of the German cinema . Wicki is 
Lines/c02/c02-003/c02-003-04.png, 1900, 133, not only a director . He began his career 
Lines/c02/c02-003/c02-003-05.png, 1674, 94, as an actor , had his first important 
Lines/c02/c02-003/c02-003-06.png, 1833, 128, film ro*?5le in Ka"utner's " Die letzt 
Lines/c02/c02-003/c02-003-07.png, 1746, 123, Bru"cke , " and he also appears in the 
Lines/c02/c02-003/c02-003-08.png, 951, 100, new Antonioni film . 
Lines/c02/c02-012/c02-012-00.png, 1787, 95, Every unnecessary detail , all superfluous local 
Lines/c02/c02-012/c02-012-01.png, 1686, 105, colouring must be eliminated . He does not 
Lines/c02/c02-012/c02-012-02.png, 1796, 121, want the accuracy of a police photograph , 
Lines/c02/c02-012/c02-012-03.png, 1721, 80, but rather he wants to show the eternal in 
Lines/c02/c02-012/c02-012-04.png, 1765, 122, every instant . " The chilling horror of " Mala- 
Lines/c02/c02-012/c02-012-05.png, 1784, 98, chias " is due as much to Wicki the photo- 
Lines/c02/c02-012/c02-012-06.png, 1775, 108, grapher as to Wicki the director . His earlier 
Lines/c02/c02-012/c02-012-07.png, 1770, 129, film , " Die Bru"cke , " was equally terrifying , 
Lines/c02/c02-012/c02-012-08.png, 1799, 96, but here the director moves out of the world 
Lines/c02/c02-012/c02-012-09.png, 1805, 103, of reality into an icy supernatural vacuum 
Lines/c02/c02-049/c02-049-00.png, 1855, 144, Strangely enough , the Berlin audience received 
Lines/c02/c02-049/c02-049-01.png, 1935, 138, the film with extreme coolness , much preferring 
Lines/c02/c02-049/c02-049-02.png, 1868, 140, Jean-Luc Godard's disappointing " Une Femme

Lines/m03/m03-114/m03-114-05.png, 2063, 171, mood . Even the Indian servants relaxed , knowing ,

Lines/m03/m03-118/m03-118-03.png, 1725, 59, was impatient for it . This afternoon , then , we climbed 
Lines/m03/m03-118/m03-118-04.png, 1688, 53, a promontory , a mass of clean rock crowned with 
Lines/m03/m03-118/m03-118-05.png, 1740, 50, trees and bushes , that stood well out over the lake . 
Lines/m03/m03-095/m03-095-00.png, 1835, 132, I had a distinct impression that the

Lines/m03/m03-095/m03-095-05.png, 1952, 113, another impression that became more 
Lines/m03/m03-095/m03-095-06.png, 1867, 143, and more definite , namely , that

Lines/m03/m03-110/m03-110-06.png, 1941, 170, would be inopportune ; and with the idea came 
Lines/m03/m03-110/m03-110-07.png, 1948, 157, a somewhat vulgar impulse , which I refused , 
Lines/m03/m03-110/m03-110-08.png, 1835, 185, to watch Mr Septimus more closely , Mrs

Lines/e06/e06-049/e06-049-01.png, 1663, 144, appear to be the simplest case - 
Lines/e06/e06-049/e06-049-02.png, 1653, 147, that of flat fish on the bottom . 
Lines/e06/e06-049/e06-049-03.png, 1820, 170, The evidence suggest that the fish are 
Lines/e06/e06-049/e06-049-04.png, 1859, 185, aware of the moving footrope before

Lines/e06/e06-049/e06-049-06.png, 1791, 181, it , swimming at the same speed 
Lines/e06/e06-049/e06-049-07.png, 1983, 145, for an unknown period of time , until 
Lines/e06/e06-049/e06-049-08.png, 1981, 176, they become ( 1 ) tired , or ( 2 ) more used 
Lines/e06/e06-049/e06-049-09.png, 1042, 185, to the disturbance . 
Lines/e06/e06-070/e06-070-00.png, 1870, 122, Actually the seine net has little or no cover . 
Lines/e06/e06-070/e06-070-01.png, 1793, 124, And in this film the rise of the fish was 
Lines/e06/e06-070/e06-070-02.png, 1947, 124, small , a matter of a foot or two . With round 
Lines/e06/e06-070/e06-070-03.png, 1902, 183, fish like haddock , which would hardly 
Lines/e06/e06-070/e06-070-04.png, 1690, 150, find safety on the bottom , this cover 
Lines/e06/e06-070/e06-070-05.png, 1875, 110, would seem to be even more essential ; 
Lines/e06/e06-070/e06-070-06.png, 1870, 134, but more films are needed to prove this . 
Lines/e06/e06-070/e06-070-07.png, 1967, 160, Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered 
Lines/e06/e06-070/e06-070-08.png, 1731, 125, essential to catch round fish whose

Lines/e06/e06-006/e06-006-03.png, 1748, 101, for spawning . Both result in crowding , 
Lines/e06/e06-006/e06-006-04.png, 1814, 79, so there is no need to try to separate 
Lines/e06/e06-006/e06-006-05.png, 1796, 91, them - thank Heaven ! A good picture of 
Lines/e06/e06-006/e06-006-06.png, 1883, 102, this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning

Lines/e06/e06-021/e06-021-01.png, 1766, 135, fish at a certain spawning ground may 
Lines/e06/e06-021/e06-021-02.png, 1962, 128, be accidental . Yet there will always be some 
Lines/e06/e06-021/e06-021-03.png, 1871, 135, that find it if enough are travelling , just as 
Lines/e06/e06-021/e06-021-04.png, 1776, 128, the robin who gets back exactly may be 
Lines/e06/e06-021/e06-021-05.png, 1830, 152, only one among thousands who do not . 
Lines/e06/e06-021/e06-021-06.png, 1673, 136, But this southerly migration is not 
Lines/e06/e06-021/e06-021-07.png, 1980, 136, accidental . Being contranatant or against 
Lines/e06/e06-021/e06-021-08.png, 1953, 153, the drift , it probably has a survival value 
Lines/e06/e06-021/e06-021-09.png, 1845, 135, in ensuring that the fry after hatching 
Lines/e06/e06-021/e06-021-10.png, 1933, 108, are drifted back into the normal home 
Lines/e06/e06-000/e06-000-00.png, 1604, 133, This could hardly happen without the 
Lines/e06/e06-000/e06-000-01.png, 1705, 135, herring having some orientation with the 
Lines/e06/e06-000/e06-000-02.png, 1808, 115, sea bottom . It means that the crowding 
Lines/e06/e06-000/e06-000-03.png, 1812, 139, is caused during the daytime , and that 
Lines/e06/e06-000/e06-000-04.png, 1839, 137, the herring must continue to migrate over 
Lines/e06/e06-000/e06-000-05.png, 1791, 133, the ground as well as in midwater and 
Lines/e06/e06-000/e06-000-06.png, 1874, 126, during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia 
Lines/e06/e06-000/e06-000-07.png, 1065, 116, is always from the north ) . 
Lines/e06/e06-037/e06-037-00.png, 1776, 95, The East Anglian behaviour ( see p. 82 ) 
Lines/e06/e06-037/e06-037-01.png, 1699, 77, has always differed from that of the 
Lines/e06/e06-037/e06-037-02.png, 1730, 76, summer fisheries . There is the " swim " 
Lines/e06/e06-037/e06-037-03.png, 1546, 96, at slack waters , even in daylight 
Lines/e06/e06-037/e06-037-04.png, 1725, 96, sometimes ; and the high swimming , 
Lines/e06/e06-037/e06-037-05.png, 1779, 96, when fish are caught only in the top 
Lines/e06/e06-037/e06-037-06.png, 1793, 92, few yards of netting . These and other 
Lines/e06/e06-037/e06-037-07.png, 1917, 86, fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar 
Lines/e06/e06-037/e06-037-08.png, 1911, 83, to this fishery , which unfortunately seems 
Lines/e06/e06-037/e06-037-09.png, 1812, 84, to be dying out ; but a full discussion of 
Lines/e06/e06-037/e06-037-10.png, 1596, 76, them is beyond the present scope . 
Lines/e06/e06-010/e06-010-00.png, 1734, 146, In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom . 
Lines/e06/e06-010/e06-010-01.png, 1718, 137, Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure . But 
Lines/e06/e06-010/e06-010-02.png, 1742, 151, they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until 
Lines/e06/e06-010/e06-010-03.png, 1787, 154, in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the 
Lines/e06/e06-010/e06-010-04.png, 1711, 148, echo-sounders . Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach 
Lines/e06/e06-010/e06-010-05.png, 1670, 126, their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable 
Lines/e06/e06-010/e06-010-06.png, 1703, 162, gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring- 
Lines/e06/e06-010/e06-010-07.png, 1049, 155, spawning herring are always found . 
Lines/e06/e06-026/e06-026-00.png, 1543, 194, Drift in another form probably 
Lines/e06/e06-026/e06-026-01.png, 1812, 193, explains how these migrating herring 
Lines/e06/e06-026/e06-026-02.png, 1637, 159, are biased to east or west by the 
Lines/e06/e06-026/e06-026-03.png, 1707, 194, different winds . Strong westerlies 
Lines/e06/e06-026/e06-026-04.png, 1595, 174, are well known to bring good 
Lines/e06/e06-026/e06-026-05.png, 1609, 191, longshore fishings . The surface 
Lines/e06/e06-026/e06-026-06.png, 1910, 187, water that is blown offshore must 
Lines/e06/e06-026/e06-026-07.png, 1900, 185, be replaced by an underflow bringing 
Lines/e06/e06-026/e06-026-08.png, 1703, 194, with it the herring to the Norfolk 
Lines/e06/e06-026/e06-026-09.png, 1117, 167, and Suffolk beaches . 
Lines/e06/e06-030/e06-030-00.png, 1800, 185, Easterly winds , on the other hand , 
Lines/e06/e06-030/e06-030-01.png, 1783, 197, mean no herring along the shore , as 
Lines/e06/e06-030/e06-030-02.png, 1801, 169, recent years have shown . A succession 
Lines/e06/e06-030/e06-030-03.png, 1825, 146, of winds is needed for this effect of 
Lines/e06/e06-030/e06-030-04.png, 1714, 184, course - one breeze will not do it , 
Lines/e06/e06-030/e06-030-05.png, 1745, 193, though a very hard westerly will 
Lines/e06/e06-030/e06-030-06.png, 1662, 152, often start off the " local " herring ; 
Lines/e06/e06-030/e06-030-07.png, 1911, 192, but quite apart from this wind effect 
Lines/e06/e06-030/e06-030-08.png, 1662, 175, there is an easterly drift special 
Lines/e06/e06-030/e06-030-09.png, 1711, 161, to this rump of coastline , caused by 
Lines/e06/e06-030/e06-030-10.png, 1998, 189, the meeting of water from north and south . 
Lines/e06/e06-053/e06-053-00.png, 1784, 144, Then they stop swimming and are caught . In 
Lines/e06/e06-053/e06-053-01.png, 1639, 143, the seine-net film this usually seemed to 
Lines/e06/e06-053/e06-053-02.png, 1747, 149, happen just after the fish had risen above 
Lines/e06/e06-053/e06-053-03.png, 1692, 142, the footrope , and presumably out of its 
Lines/e06/e06-053/e06-053-04.png, 1945, 172, field of disturbance , or bow wave . This suggests 
Lines/e06/e06-053/e06-053-05.png, 1733, 156, that the wave might be transmitted by the 
Lines/e06/e06-053/e06-053-06.png, 1805, 153, sea-bed , though the footrope in this case 
Lines/e06/e06-053/e06-053-07.png, 1708, 156, was actually just off the bottom and was 
Lines/e06/e06-053/e06-053-08.png, 1308, 158, indeed passing over some fish . 
Lines/e06/e06-015/e06-015-00.png, 1820, 178, The joint evidence of echo-sounders 
Lines/e06/e06-015/e06-015-01.png, 1843, 188, and fishing gear leads to an overall 
Lines/e06/e06-015/e06-015-02.png, 1580, 188, though somewhat dim picture . 
Lines/e06/e06-015/e06-015-03.png, 1720, 114, The details are harder still to see . 
Lines/e06/e06-015/e06-015-04.png, 1973, 189, Drift Effects . At East Anglia , for instance , 
Lines/e06/e06-015/e06-015-05.png, 1775, 189, shoals that gather at the Knoll or 
Lines/e06/e06-015/e06-015-06.png, 1631, 123, other banks are most of them 
Lines/e06/e06-015/e06-015-07.png, 1541, 174, going to travel a hundred 
Lines/e06/e06-015/e06-015-08.png, 1694, 164, miles farther south before they

Lines/h07/h07-080a/h07-080a-02.png, 1819, 153, moved with them and were thus eligible to rent # 
Lines/h07/h07-080a/h07-080a-03.png, 2177, 143, a corporation house . Additional workers are recruited through 
Lines/h07/h07-080a/h07-080a-04.png, 2026, 153, the industrial selection scheme by arrangement with 
Lines/h07/h07-080a/h07-080a-05.png, 2233, 168, the # Ministry of Labour . This scheme is designed 
Lines/h07/h07-080a/h07-080a-06.png, 1977, 131, to ensure that vacancies in the London new towns 
Lines/h07/h07-080a/h07-080a-07.png, 2159, 160, which cannot be filled locally are filled as far as 
Lines/h07/h07-080a/h07-080a-08.png, 2083, 157, possible from people on London housing lists , who thus 
Lines/h07/h07-080a/h07-080a-09.png, 2018, 120, become entitled to rent a house in the new town . 
Lines/h07/h07-030/h07-030-00.png, 1589, 110, Some development corporations 
Lines/h07/h07-030/h07-030-01.png, 1514, 110, have sought to attract private 
Lines/h07/h07-030/h07-030-02.png, 1533, 112, investors by leasing part of the 
Lines/h07/h07-030/h07-030-03.png, 1332, 113, shopping area to companies 
Lines/h07/h07-030/h07-030-04.png, 1327, 96, experienced in commercial

Lines/h07/h07-030/h07-030-06.png, 1521, 123, the building and letting of the 
Lines/h07/h07-030/h07-030-07.png, 1828, 112, shops . But corporations have generally 
Lines/h07/h07-030/h07-030-08.png, 1778, 119, found it more satisfactory to build 
Lines/h07/h07-030/h07-030-09.png, 1543, 124, themselves , leasing the shops 
Lines/h07/h07-007/h07-007-00.png, 1809, 83, There is no reason to suppose that this pattern is peculiar to 
Lines/h07/h07-007/h07-007-01.png, 1864, 80, Crawley . The development corporations have aimed at a varied 
Lines/h07/h07-007/h07-007-02.png, 1653, 79, pattern of industry , offering a reasonable choice of 
Lines/h07/h07-007/h07-007-03.png, 1888, 82, employer as well as choice of occupation for men , women and 
Lines/h07/h07-007/h07-007-04.png, 1664, 71, school-leavers , with due regard to the industries 
Lines/h07/h07-007/h07-007-05.png, 1892, 83, already established in their towns . Inevitably engineering , 
Lines/h07/h07-007/h07-007-06.png, 1768, 83, including the motor vehicle and aircraft industries , 
Lines/h07/h07-007/h07-007-07.png, 1849, 60, predominates in all the London new towns since these are 
Lines/h07/h07-007/h07-007-08.png, 1698, 83, among the industries which have expanded most 
Lines/h07/h07-007/h07-007-09.png, 1741, 75, during the last ten years in the country generally . 
Lines/h07/h07-071/h07-071-00.png, 1743, 124, During this period , when large numbers of school- 
Lines/h07/h07-071/h07-071-01.png, 1651, 97, leavers will be looking for jobs , there 
Lines/h07/h07-071/h07-071-02.png, 1747, 95, will be relatively few retirements . For the most 
Lines/h07/h07-071/h07-071-03.png, 1681, 93, part therefore local employment can 
Lines/h07/h07-071/h07-071-04.png, 1730, 119, be provided only by the expansion of existing 
Lines/h07/h07-071/h07-071-05.png, 1814, 117, industry and the introduction of new factories , 
Lines/h07/h07-071/h07-071-06.png, 1778, 96, laboratories and offices , and the expected but 
Lines/h07/h07-071/h07-071-07.png, 1844, 92, not easily stimulated development of the service 
Lines/h07/h07-071/h07-071-08.png, 1684, 111, industries . Schemes for training young people in 
Lines/h07/h07-071/h07-071-09.png, 1836, 107, industry and commerce will be particularly important in 
Lines/h07/h07-078/h07-078-00.png, 1653, 90, At the present time in most of the towns 
Lines/h07/h07-078/h07-078-01.png, 1652, 126, the waiting period has tended to grow , partly 
Lines/h07/h07-078/h07-078-02.png, 1662, 106, because the buoyancy of industry generates 
Lines/h07/h07-078/h07-078-03.png, 1547, 106, increasing demands , partly because in 
Lines/h07/h07-078/h07-078-04.png, 1539, 100, recent years the pressure on the building 
Lines/h07/h07-078/h07-078-05.png, 1597, 109, industry , the shortage of bricks and other 
Lines/h07/h07-078/h07-078-06.png, 1758, 100, materials , and the shortage of skilled labour , 
Lines/h07/h07-078/h07-078-07.png, 1749, 94, especially in the finishing trades , has made 
Lines/h07/h07-078/h07-078-08.png, 1646, 93, it difficult for corporations to achieve 
Lines/h07/h07-078/h07-078-09.png, 936, 88, their full programme . 
Lines/h07/h07-051b/h07-051b-00.png, 1757, 89, These services develop at their own pace 
Lines/h07/h07-051b/h07-051b-01.png, 1664, 89, in response to local demand , however , 
Lines/h07/h07-051b/h07-051b-02.png, 1814, 85, and little can be done to stimulate them . 
Lines/h07/h07-051b/h07-051b-03.png, 1654, 107, In practice it has not proved possible

Lines/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-02.png, 1780, 118, little interest in the new towns , probably because of 
Lines/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-03.png, 1627, 115, the difficulty in the early years in recruiting 
Lines/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-04.png, 1797, 133, suitable staff , especially junior staff , locally . 
Lines/h07/h07-054a/h07-054a-05.png, 1759, 128, There is evidence of greater interest today ,

Lines/n03/n03-091/n03-091-04.png, 1882, 122, The yawl , riding the high waves with an air that 
Lines/n03/n03-091/n03-091-05.png, 1859, 100, might have made an ocean liner envious , seemed 
Lines/n03/n03-091/n03-091-06.png, 1802, 110, prepared to make a safe though violent landing 
Lines/n03/n03-091/n03-091-07.png, 1879, 103, when there came a sudden gust of wind 
Lines/n03/n03-091/n03-091-08.png, 555, 83, from the west .

Lines/n03/n03-097/n03-097-03.png, 1998, 134, Willie Kim was speechless , only his slant 
Lines/n03/n03-097/n03-097-04.png, 1855, 160, black eyes showing any emotion . With a 
Lines/n03/n03-097/n03-097-05.png, 2038, 127, quick shift of tiller , and at the same time 
Lines/n03/n03-097/n03-097-06.png, 1873, 138, jibbing the boom to which he had the 
Lines/n03/n03-097/n03-097-07.png, 1688, 155, stay rope fastened , Bill made the 
Lines/n03/n03-097/n03-097-08.png, 636, 139, yawl recover . 
Lines/n03/n03-038/n03-038-00.png, 1685, 99, He had almost entirely settled back into his old 
Lines/n03/n03-038/n03-038-01.png, 1802, 125, ways , even to reading law about two hours each 
Lines/n03/n03-038/n03-038-02.png, 1781, 119, day . Though he did not refuse wine , which the 
Lines/n03/n03-038/n03-038-03.png, 1846, 124, judge always had on the table at dinner , he 
Lines/n03/n03-038/n03-038-04.png, 1730, 130, did not act as though he found it necessary 
Lines/n03/n03-038/n03-038-05.png, 1839, 137, except in moderate compliance with his father's 
Lines/n03/n03-038/n03-038-06.png, 221, 70, habit . 
Lines/n03/n03-103/n03-103-00.png, 1662, 159, It seemed to the frightened judge 
Lines/n03/n03-103/n03-103-01.png, 1722, 150, as though his son would actually 
Lines/n03/n03-103/n03-103-02.png, 1702, 106, shoot the craft in under the outer 
Lines/n03/n03-103/n03-103-03.png, 1693, 152, end of the wharf . But by pressing 
Lines/n03/n03-103/n03-103-04.png, 1557, 118, the tiller hard over and at the 
Lines/n03/n03-103/n03-103-05.png, 1798, 172, same time dropping the small sheet 
Lines/n03/n03-103/n03-103-06.png, 1607, 136, of wet canvas , Bill cleared the 
Lines/n03/n03-103/n03-103-07.png, 1700, 165, corner of the pier by inches , and 
Lines/n03/n03-103/n03-103-08.png, 1875, 163, with the tiller still hard over , brought 
Lines/n03/n03-103/n03-103-09.png, 1683, 163, the yawl up against the waves 
Lines/n03/n03-113/n03-113-00.png, 1849, 192, " Hello , Dad ! " Bill called . " I hope you 
Lines/n03/n03-113/n03-113-01.png, 1631, 175, weren't worried . We 're going to 
Lines/n03/n03-113/n03-113-02.png, 1710, 192, drag the boat ashore and turn 
Lines/n03/n03-113/n03-113-03.png, 1598, 157, her over . She has a foot of 
Lines/n03/n03-113/n03-113-04.png, 1568, 106, water in her . I wouldn't be 
Lines/n03/n03-113/n03-113-05.png, 1544, 151, surprised if we broke all 
Lines/n03/n03-113/n03-113-06.png, 1653, 148, speed records on the way in . 
Lines/n03/n03-113/n03-113-07.png, 1886, 177, Yes sir , I am slightly wet , and 
Lines/n03/n03-113/n03-113-08.png, 1749, 131, Buck would be wetter if he 
Lines/n03/n03-113/n03-113-09.png, 1524, 103, had more clothes on . " 
Lines/n03/n03-064/n03-064-00.png, 1715, 181, Around that rounded rocky promontory where the 
Lines/n03/n03-064/n03-064-01.png, 1775, 176, white spray could be seen flying across the distance 
Lines/n03/n03-064/n03-064-02.png, 1689, 184, of a mile and a half , came the yawl under her full 
Lines/n03/n03-064/n03-064-03.png, 1762, 194, triangular sail , and to the judge's frightened eyes , so 
Lines/n03/n03-064/n03-064-04.png, 1548, 109, close to the rocks that it would be dashed 
Lines/n03/n03-064/n03-064-05.png, 1579, 163, against them with the lift of the next wave . 
Lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-00.png, 1609, 114, Oi , not yet , you oaf . What do you think my 
Lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-01.png, 1461, 126, mouth is ? A billposter's bucket to be 
Lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-02.png, 1684, 104, plunged in at random ? He 'd learned to

Lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-04.png, 1696, 119, situation became ludicrous , as when they 
Lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-05.png, 1666, 110, were both caught in the raw when he 'd 
Lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-06.png, 1530, 111, forgotten to lock his door and Derek 
Lines/k07/k07-141/k07-141-07.png, 1256, 118, had walked in unexpectedly . 
Lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-00.png, 1649, 101, To observe the colour rise in her cheek 
Lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-01.png, 1706, 117, and hear her breath come faster , to see 
Lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-02.png, 1719, 112, the slight beads of sweat come out on 
Lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-03.png, 1489, 114, her glistening skin and see her move 
Lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-04.png, 1680, 97, with uncontrolled rhythm . To have her twist 
Lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-05.png, 1626, 110, in an attempt to receive a caress he was 
Lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-06.png, 1738, 105, purposely withholding , to hear her deep-throated 
Lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-07.png, 1555, 125, moan of full satisfaction and feel her 
Lines/k07/k07-122/k07-122-08.png, 1063, 97, shivering , clawing surrender . 
Lines/k07/k07-176/k07-176-00.png, 1778, 118, You youngsters always overestimate 
Lines/k07/k07-176/k07-176-01.png, 1750, 130, yourselves . You can take it from 
Lines/k07/k07-176/k07-176-02.png, 1705, 76, me that he can and does . But 
Lines/k07/k07-176/k07-176-03.png, 1861, 135, even if he were impotent I 'd still 
Lines/k07/k07-176/k07-176-04.png, 1763, 90, love and want him . There are 
Lines/k07/k07-176/k07-176-05.png, 1785, 118, sides to me you 'll never know . 
Lines/k07/k07-176/k07-176-06.png, 1853, 144, Don't you feel guilty living with 
Lines/k07/k07-176/k07-176-07.png, 1782, 145, me ? Often ! Don't you ? Mary had 
Lines/k07/k07-176/k07-176-08.png, 1844, 82, married her bill broker some time 
Lines/k07/k07-176/k07-176-09.png, 1911, 139, ago and he now shuddered when he 
Lines/k07/k07-176/k07-176-10.png, 1767, 87, remembered the clinical weekends 
Lines/k07/k07-176/k07-176-11.png, 1698, 86, he used to spend with her . 
Lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-00.png, 1802, 132, You perverted sex-maniac , you wouldn't 
Lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-01.png, 1758, 118, dare . Show me what you can do and 
Lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-02.png, 1597, 110, I 'll tell you if you need help . 
Lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-03.png, 1707, 104, Once he came back to the subject 
Lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-04.png, 1826, 132, of her marriage and asked her why 
Lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-05.png, 1921, 125, she was going to marry her sculptor . 
Lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-06.png, 1692, 113, Because I love him , of course . 
Lines/k07/k07-152/k07-152-07.png, 1121, 127, What do you think ? 
Lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-00.png, 1726, 122, Not so dusty , she might say afterwards , drawing at 
Lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-01.png, 1596, 99, a cigarette . It 's a wow ! he said . She kissed 
Lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-02.png, 1698, 111, him motherly : You just wait till you teach the 
Lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-03.png, 1736, 95, girl you really love . He didn't protest any more 
Lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-04.png, 1656, 94, to say he loved her because he knew it to 
Lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-05.png, 1591, 92, be untrue . Instead he said : Will that be 
Lines/k07/k07-125/k07-125-06.png, 806, 90, better ? She nodded : 
Lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-00.png, 1671, 87, No . I 'm not your type . I 'd make you miserable . I 
Lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-01.png, 1669, 98, mean that . I 'd very probably be unfaithful and 
Lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-02.png, 1815, 106, that 'd kill you . Then I 'd be unfaithful too , to teach 
Lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-03.png, 1714, 94, you a lesson . It wouldn't work . You 'd do it to 
Lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-04.png, 1739, 85, spite me . I would never do it for that reason . 
Lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-05.png, 1727, 99, To me it 'd be immaterial whether you 'd retaliate 
Lines/k07/k07-085/k07-085-06.png, 1720, 105, or not . You 'd go crazy if that situation arose . 
Lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-00.png, 1640, 89, It 's man's nature to teach and to teach those 
Lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-01.png, 1511, 95, we love is double pleasure . And she 
Lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-02.png, 1670, 120, might add : And don't forget to leave the

Lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-04.png, 1620, 119, fumble in the dark . She had many direct 
Lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-05.png, 1547, 128, comments like that . Once she quietly 
Lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-06.png, 1636, 121, pushed him back when he kissed her too 
Lines/k07/k07-134/k07-134-07.png, 787, 137, fully and too soon : 
Lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-00.png, 1551, 101, But he 's a lot older , isn't he ? 
Lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-01.png, 1663, 112, I suppose so . What attracts you ? 
Lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-02.png, 1687, 102, It can't be physical ? Of course 
Lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-03.png, 1769, 120, not ! I love him for what he is 
Lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-04.png, 1699, 121, - he 's so great I 'm a bit scared 
Lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-05.png, 1813, 116, of him - a woman must be a bit 
Lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-06.png, 1619, 112, scared to be really in love . 
Lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-07.png, 1583, 117, That 's why you could never 
Lines/k07/k07-158/k07-158-08.png, 506, 94, love me ? 
Lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-00.png, 1574, 127, They 'd just had time to nip into the 
Lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-01.png, 1585, 126, bathroom and stood there shivering for 
Lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-02.png, 1616, 113, fifteen minutes while their guest was 
Lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-03.png, 1502, 122, smoking a cigarette waiting for him . 
Lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-04.png, 1482, 138, At last Derek got tired and left . 
Lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-05.png, 1639, 121, Just in time , erupted Charlie . If he 'd 
Lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-06.png, 1538, 121, stayed any longer I 'd jolly well 
Lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-07.png, 1661, 116, have asked him to join us . I 'm so 
Lines/k07/k07-146/k07-146-08.png, 1681, 110, darned cold I could do with two men . 
Lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-00.png, 1690, 136, Correct , ducky ! You just wait till 
Lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-01.png, 1813, 124, you meet the girl who thinks you 're a 
Lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-02.png, 1826, 153, god . It 'll make you feel like one ! 
Lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-03.png, 1759, 124, You think that sculptor 's a god ? 
Lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-04.png, 1828, 124, Perhaps , in a way . All I know is 
Lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-05.png, 1796, 103, that I need him . He kissed the 
Lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-06.png, 1882, 90, heart beat in her throat . But how 
Lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-07.png, 1741, 122, about the physical side ? You 're 
Lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-08.png, 1774, 95, quite an erotic little beast ; can 
Lines/k07/k07-166/k07-166-09.png, 989, 101, he satisfy that ? 
Lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-00.png, 1661, 89, He sat down and ran his finger down along her 
Lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-01.png, 1631, 89, spine . Do you love me now ? Like yesterday ! I 'm 
Lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-02.png, 1763, 93, extremely fond of you . The fact that you 're beginning 
Lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-03.png, 1678, 93, to satisfy my physical wants does not change that . 
Lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-04.png, 1768, 90, Before long you 'll give me the satisfaction that 'll set 
Lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-05.png, 1750, 96, me rocking on my feet , but I 'll still be only fond of 
Lines/k07/k07-077/k07-077-06.png, 1188, 91, you . But you wouldn't marry me ? 
Lines/k07/k07-185/k07-185-00.png, 1753, 108, He often used to try to imagine 
Lines/k07/k07-185/k07-185-01.png, 1933, 109, her reactions if he had once treated 
Lines/k07/k07-185/k07-185-02.png, 1734, 100, her as he did Charlie , but his 
Lines/k07/k07-185/k07-185-03.png, 1717, 129, imagination failed . The efficient 
Lines/k07/k07-185/k07-185-04.png, 1805, 128, little Mary would probably have 
Lines/k07/k07-185/k07-185-05.png, 1957, 145, called it a shocking waste of time 
Lines/k07/k07-185/k07-185-06.png, 1680, 139, and told him to get down to 
Lines/k07/k07-185/k07-185-07.png, 1928, 114, business ! Charlie , who was perfectly 
Lines/k07/k07-185/k07-185-08.png, 1799, 90, at home at all sorts of artistic

Lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-01.png, 1647, 107, her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her 
Lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-02.png, 1684, 104, heart in the full throat . Her mouth did things he 
Lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-03.png, 1636, 106, thought no human being could stand without 
Lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-04.png, 1578, 102, dying , but he went on living in an ocean of 
Lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-05.png, 1664, 101, voluptuousness , that swelled and ebbed over him , 
Lines/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-06.png, 1308, 100, under him , in him and through him ... 
Lines/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-00.png, 1600, 89, He was having a ball ! He twiddled the TV set with 
Lines/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-01.png, 1651, 95, shaking hands . She sat calmly on the bed smoking 
Lines/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-02.png, 1528, 88, a cigarette . His face was white with two red 
Lines/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-03.png, 1675, 96, blotches . Hers was flushed and lovely . O.K. teacher ! 
Lines/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-04.png, 1733, 94, Was that any better ? You know it was ! You don't 
Lines/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-05.png, 1178, 93, need teaching , only a little coaxing . 
Lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-00.png, 1669, 97, He forgot time and place . He , the master , was gently 
Lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-01.png, 1721, 91, led along erotic paths which he knew existed , but 
Lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-02.png, 1666, 73, had never trodden . He learned how to use his 
Lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-03.png, 1783, 92, hands , how to adore that body without haste , how 
Lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-04.png, 1749, 95, to caress every inch with his mouth as well , to 
Lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-05.png, 1782, 94, creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost 
Lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-06.png, 1569, 90, himself in a rapture of kisses in places he 'd 
Lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-07.png, 1828, 88, dreamed of , where life began to ooze and quickened 
Lines/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-08.png, 1077, 65, his heart beat to a thunder .

Lines/e07/e07-108/e07-108-04.png, 1612, 91, in carriage costs because of their lightness . 
Lines/e07/e07-108/e07-108-05.png, 1733, 98, There are many types of plastic pots available ;

Lines/e07/e07-108/e07-108-07.png, 1612, 103, and others not so good . A wide range of 
Lines/e07/e07-108/e07-108-08.png, 1622, 95, plants grow quite well in plastic pots and

Lines/e07/e07-094/e07-094-05.png, 1678, 91, are made of the same compost as would have 
Lines/e07/e07-094/e07-094-06.png, 1688, 92, been used in a pot , the # only difference being 
Lines/e07/e07-094/e07-094-07.png, 1385, 97, that it is used in a slightly moister

Lines/e07/e07-105/e07-105-05.png, 1481, 80, useful for short-term operations , but are 
Lines/e07/e07-105/e07-105-06.png, 1697, 93, inclined to collapse if the plants are in them

Lines/e07/e07-066/e07-066-07.png, 1685, 111, and the latest report I have is that 
Lines/e07/e07-066/e07-066-08.png, 1190, 83, this mantis is still alive . 
Lines/e07/e07-076/e07-076-00.png, 1645, 111, The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its

Lines/e07/e07-076/e07-076-02.png, 1799, 120, handling , the annual losses are often around 
Lines/e07/e07-076/e07-076-03.png, 1634, 116, 10 per cent. , and where the handling and

Lines/e07/e07-083/e07-083-05.png, 1700, 130, for having smashed a large number # to 
Lines/e07/e07-083/e07-083-06.png, 1803, 122, relieve his feelings . On the small-to-medium 
Lines/e07/e07-083/e07-083-07.png, 1626, 118, establishment , it is a disagreeable chore 
Lines/e07/e07-083/e07-083-08.png, 1700, 120, which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm , 
Lines/e07/e07-083/e07-083-09.png, 1647, 117, whereas on larger establishments the pots 
Lines/e07/e07-083/e07-083-10.png, 1657, 125, can be sterilized or washed by machine . 
Lines/e07/e07-012/e07-012-00.png, 1546, 125, From the day it hatches in the spring 
Lines/e07/e07-012/e07-012-01.png, 1669, 89, until it dies in the late autumn , the 
Lines/e07/e07-012/e07-012-02.png, 1720, 119, praying mantis satisfies its voracity by 
Lines/e07/e07-012/e07-012-03.png, 1632, 114, eating other insects . Nine blowflies

Lines/e07/e07-012/e07-012-08.png, 1739, 114, According to Dr. Max Beier in " Fang-

Lines/e07/e07-012/e07-012-11.png, 466, 79, northwards . 
Lines/e07/e07-101/e07-101-00.png, 1693, 92, One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious 
Lines/e07/e07-101/e07-101-01.png, 1775, 86, one : the cost of a pot of any description is saved 
Lines/e07/e07-101/e07-101-02.png, 1713, 93, completely . Manufacturing the block and planting 
Lines/e07/e07-101/e07-101-03.png, 1664, 102, it is very little more trouble than normal potting , 
Lines/e07/e07-101/e07-101-04.png, 1666, 87, and a superior plant , which transplants more 
Lines/e07/e07-101/e07-101-05.png, 1728, 92, easily , is produced . The obvious limitation # 
Lines/e07/e07-101/e07-101-06.png, 1480, 80, is that soil blocks can only be used for 
Lines/e07/e07-101/e07-101-07.png, 1683, 90, propagating ; there can be no progression to a 
Lines/e07/e07-101/e07-101-08.png, 1688, 94, larger block when the plant or seedling is ready 
Lines/e07/e07-101/e07-101-09.png, 1569, 81, to be moved ; it must be planted out or 
Lines/e07/e07-101/e07-101-10.png, 224, 89, potted . 
Lines/e07/e07-112/e07-112-00.png, 1699, 174, They are slightly more difficult to 
Lines/e07/e07-112/e07-112-01.png, 1840, 168, manage , however , until a little experience 
Lines/e07/e07-112/e07-112-02.png, 1741, 188, has been gained with them . Plastic pots 
Lines/e07/e07-112/e07-112-03.png, 1891, 141, are usually more expensive than clay ones , 
Lines/e07/e07-112/e07-112-04.png, 1778, 147, but they are almost indestructible and 
Lines/e07/e07-112/e07-112-05.png, 1822, 147, will last a long time with normal care . 
Lines/e07/e07-098/e07-098-00.png, 1672, 76, Seed is sown , or seedlings are pricked out into them 
Lines/e07/e07-098/e07-098-01.png, 1540, 72, in the normal way , the only real difference 
Lines/e07/e07-098/e07-098-02.png, 1755, 97, being that more of the watering is done through a 
Lines/e07/e07-098/e07-098-03.png, 1694, 87, rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout 
Lines/e07/e07-098/e07-098-04.png, 1522, 96, of water . First-class plants of tomatoes , 
Lines/e07/e07-098/e07-098-05.png, 1581, 69, cucumbers , marrows , melons , cauliflowers , 
Lines/e07/e07-098/e07-098-06.png, 1731, 79, celery and onions , may all be raised in soil 
Lines/e07/e07-098/e07-098-07.png, 1529, 113, blocks ; so can such flowering plants as 
Lines/e07/e07-098/e07-098-08.png, 1767, 79, dahlias , chrysanthemums , salvias , sweet peas , 
Lines/e07/e07-098/e07-098-09.png, 1086, 87, lupins and numerous others . 
Lines/e07/e07-079/e07-079-00.png, 1636, 122, The storage problem puts clay pots at a 
Lines/e07/e07-079/e07-079-01.png, 1733, 120, definite disadvantage . They are fairly heavy 
Lines/e07/e07-079/e07-079-02.png, 1728, 118, and difficult things to accommodate and 
Lines/e07/e07-079/e07-079-03.png, 1764, 127, they must have some protection from severe 
Lines/e07/e07-079/e07-079-04.png, 1709, 109, weather , which can be quite a headache in 
Lines/e07/e07-079/e07-079-05.png, 1567, 114, a small garden . While admitting that 
Lines/e07/e07-079/e07-079-06.png, 1611, 96, broken pots have on occasions provided 
Lines/e07/e07-079/e07-079-07.png, 1776, 112, artists with delightful studies , there is no 
Lines/e07/e07-079/e07-079-08.png, 1567, 123, doubt that a pile of badly stacked , 
Lines/e07/e07-079/e07-079-09.png, 1579, 125, half-broken pots is an unlovely sight 
Lines/e07/e07-079/e07-079-10.png, 957, 134, from any point of view . 
Lines/e07/e07-000/e07-000-00.png, 1673, 94, WE have not yet reached the stage in Britain 
Lines/e07/e07-000/e07-000-01.png, 1753, 96, when 50 planes are engaged in spreading 1,500 tons 
Lines/e07/e07-000/e07-000-02.png, 1586, 68, of DDT and fuel oil over 3 million acres or when 
Lines/e07/e07-000/e07-000-03.png, 1793, 73, 20 million acres are sprayed with dieldrin . An eye- 
Lines/e07/e07-000/e07-000-04.png, 1842, 82, witness described one sprayed area as literally rank with 
Lines/e07/e07-000/e07-000-05.png, 1799, 88, the stench of small game and birds dead from insecti- 
Lines/e07/e07-000/e07-000-06.png, 459, 74, cide poisoning . 
Lines/e07/e07-086/e07-086-00.png, 1476, 114, It is not easy to make an economic 
Lines/e07/e07-086/e07-086-01.png, 1761, 108, comparison between clay pots and the various 
Lines/e07/e07-086/e07-086-02.png, 1750, 134, substitutes ; the former may last indefinitely 
Lines/e07/e07-086/e07-086-03.png, 1471, 94, with luck , while the latter are often 
Lines/e07/e07-086/e07-086-04.png, 1628, 117, expendable used only once . Clay pots are 
Lines/e07/e07-086/e07-086-05.png, 1673, 119, efficient and congenial containers in which 
Lines/e07/e07-086/e07-086-06.png, 1704, 117, to grow plants . In their proper setting they 
Lines/e07/e07-086/e07-086-07.png, 1650, 91, are not unattractive and , in spite of 
Lines/e07/e07-086/e07-086-08.png, 1685, 126, their shortcomings , most gardeners have 
Lines/e07/e07-086/e07-086-09.png, 1212, 121, a nostalgic affection for them . 
Lines/e07/e07-072/e07-072-00.png, 1685, 113, DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes 
Lines/e07/e07-072/e07-072-01.png, 1681, 100, since the end of the war , clay pots are 
Lines/e07/e07-072/e07-072-02.png, 1693, 94, still in greatest demand . It is mostly 
Lines/e07/e07-072/e07-072-03.png, 1677, 76, in the smaller sizes that the substitutes 
Lines/e07/e07-072/e07-072-04.png, 1539, 103, have made headway , and although 
Lines/e07/e07-072/e07-072-05.png, 1732, 103, numerous small clay pots are used each 
Lines/e07/e07-072/e07-072-06.png, 1619, 94, year , they are fewer than they were 10 
Lines/e07/e07-072/e07-072-07.png, 1696, 109, years ago . In the larger sizes there is still 
Lines/e07/e07-072/e07-072-08.png, 1629, 94, no real substitute for clay that can be 
Lines/e07/e07-072/e07-072-09.png, 1768, 109, obtained at a comparable price , except the 
Lines/e07/e07-072/e07-072-10.png, 1636, 119, bituminized paper pots which are used on 
Lines/e07/e07-072/e07-072-11.png, 1658, 85, commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes 
Lines/m01/m01-022/m01-022-00.png, 1849, 92, His usually animated face was expressionless and looked flat , 
Lines/m01/m01-022/m01-022-01.png, 1939, 90, as though his nose had been pushed back and his eyes and cheeks 
Lines/m01/m01-022/m01-022-02.png, 1852, 71, brought forward . He mouthed a low mutter , punctuated at intervals 
Lines/m01/m01-022/m01-022-03.png, 1732, 97, with a few syllables of a crazy and incoherent jargon . As 
Lines/m01/m01-022/m01-022-04.png, 1725, 89, Steve looked at him his mouth suddenly snapped shut , 
Lines/m01/m01-022/m01-022-05.png, 593, 87, with jaws askew . 
Lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-00.png, 1889, 146, He slapped himself in the face and 
Lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-01.png, 1807, 145, cuffed the sides of his head . Then 
Lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-02.png, 1652, 147, by degrees the rotating objects 
Lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-03.png, 1925, 205, slowed , and coming into focus took 
Lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-04.png, 1861, 149, the form of the furnishings in Dan 
Lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-05.png, 1939, 155, Brown's living room . He stood up un- 
Lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-06.png, 2029, 159, steadily and looked about the room , 
Lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-07.png, 1879, 167, trying to gather his wits . Outside the 
Lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-08.png, 1993, 148, dusk was settling over Dow's Lake and 
Lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-09.png, 1699, 186, the heights beyond were in 
Lines/m01/m01-012/m01-012-10.png, 1783, 163, silhouette , already a solid black . 
Lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-00.png, 1724, 125, He rose from his breakfast-nook bench 
Lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-01.png, 1778, 150, and came into the livingroom , where 
Lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-02.png, 1662, 139, Heather and Steve stood aghast at 
Lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-03.png, 1739, 169, his entrance . He came , almost falling 
Lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-04.png, 1825, 161, forward in an ungainly shuffle , neck 
Lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-05.png, 1777, 169, thrust out , arms dangling loosely . 
Lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-06.png, 1868, 166, Then , abruptly , he drew himself up 
Lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-07.png, 1724, 144, and walked on the very tips of 
Lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-08.png, 1610, 121, his toes . He stretched his arms 
Lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-09.png, 1947, 166, over his head and yawned agape , 
Lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-10.png, 1661, 159, drawing-in great breaths that 
Lines/m01/m01-049/m01-049-11.png, 1821, 105, became great sighs of ecstacy . 
Lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-00.png, 1719, 110, Then something like a zest for living began to come back 
Lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-01.png, 1655, 100, to Steve and he squeezed her hand . Her face took on 
Lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-02.png, 1802, 97, enough animation to produce a wan smile . Dan's low mut- 
Lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-03.png, 1696, 105, tering was just audible from the kitchen . And Steve 
Lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-04.png, 1834, 77, could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions 
Lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-05.png, 1793, 100, she was growing cold and numb with shock . She had seen 
Lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-06.png, 1722, 99, Dan , or rather the physical relic of him - the empty 
Lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-07.png, 1721, 108, shell of flesh and bone , devoid of intellect and 
Lines/m01/m01-032/m01-032-08.png, 807, 102, personality . 
Lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-00.png, 1801, 136, Coming around the great mass of the Chateau 
Lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-01.png, 1724, 152, Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop . A 
Lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-02.png, 1703, 168, flying saucer was tilting and dipping over 
Lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-03.png, 1453, 114, the War Memorial . There was a deep 
Lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-04.png, 1817, 170, whirring sound , and a high-pitched hissing 
Lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-05.png, 1719, 149, overtone that sang in his ears with an 
Lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-06.png, 1818, 151, almost painful sharpness . He reversed and 
Lines/m01/m01-095/m01-095-07.png, 1504, 147, turned back on McKenzie Avenue . 
Lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-00.png, 1591, 112, So they proceeded to see if the coast 
Lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-01.png, 1477, 109, was clear . The street was quiet and 
Lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-02.png, 1709, 131, deserted , and there were neither sight 
Lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-03.png, 1662, 127, nor sound of flying saucers . So they 
Lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-04.png, 1787, 121, ventured forth and made their way on 
Lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-05.png, 1584, 101, foot to Dan's house . Dan came 
Lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-06.png, 1729, 150, to the door at their ring but neglected 
Lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-07.png, 1596, 157, to offer any greeting . He was deeply 
Lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-08.png, 1749, 105, preoccupied , and it seemed that the 
Lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-09.png, 1645, 129, ringing of a doorbell was to him 
Lines/m01/m01-125/m01-125-10.png, 1337, 109, a new and strange phenomenon . 
Lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-00.png, 1607, 157, And these had been his great qualities , 
Lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-01.png, 1578, 99, so attractive to her . The Base Station had 
Lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-02.png, 1734, 140, gone before , discharging its narrow plane of 
Lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-03.png, 1777, 171, 4ementalating energy along the length of 
Lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-04.png, 1555, 136, the Earth's imaginary longitudes , moving 
Lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-05.png, 1795, 144, eastward like a knife-edged twilight in 
Lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-06.png, 1639, 142, reversed progression . It had brought the 
Lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-07.png, 1825, 147, First Stage in the Thetan pattern of conquest , 
Lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-08.png, 1627, 152, the empty-minded receptiveness that 
Lines/m01/m01-038/m01-038-09.png, 1736, 169, prepared the way for the Second Stage . 
Lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-00.png, 1759, 161, His whole attitude was a mixture of 
Lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-01.png, 1773, 225, impatience pending an awaited 
Lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-02.png, 1667, 196, communication and of a vague 
Lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-03.png, 1948, 191, perplexity respecting his surroundings 
Lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-04.png, 1807, 142, and the purpose he was to serve . 
Lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-05.png, 1725, 183, Finally , being so obviously on their own , 
Lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-06.png, 1976, 95, Heather and Steve tried to make themselves 
Lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-07.png, 1613, 113, at home . Steve switched on Dan's 
Lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-08.png, 2059, 169, powerful , world-wide radio and systematically 
Lines/m01/m01-136/m01-136-09.png, 1828, 190, turned the tuning knob through all the

Lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-00.png, 1675, 171, There is just a hope that we may uncover 
Lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-01.png, 1767, 168, some weakness , and find a way of fighting 
Lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-02.png, 1816, 165, back at them . " Heather agreed , and suggested 
Lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-03.png, 1837, 174, that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra- 
Lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-04.png, 1856, 182, ting how the Thetan machinations had been 
Lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-05.png, 1877, 187, working out . It occurred to Steve that this may 
Lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-06.png, 1951, 158, not have been entirely an objective suggestion 
Lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-07.png, 1821, 184, on her part ; but he thought it a good idea 
Lines/m01/m01-121/m01-121-08.png, 458, 108, nevertheless . 
Lines/m01/m01-149/m01-149-00.png, 1952, 144, They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue , where 
Lines/m01/m01-149/m01-149-01.png, 1989, 130, he waited . The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street . 
Lines/m01/m01-149/m01-149-02.png, 1976, 144, But not for long , for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon 
Lines/m01/m01-149/m01-149-03.png, 1933, 158, the Avenue from its many tributary streets . It might have 
Lines/m01/m01-149/m01-149-04.png, 2112, 133, been a normal business-day bustle , except for two anomalies . 
Lines/m01/m01-149/m01-149-05.png, 1855, 161, First , it was Sunday morning ; and , second , everyone 
Lines/m01/m01-149/m01-149-06.png, 1940, 126, walked , or drove , or waited as a person possessed of 
Lines/m01/m01-149/m01-149-07.png, 1070, 127, a single all-exclusive purpose . 
Lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-00.png, 1711, 137, There was utter imbecility in his blank face . Presently the 
Lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-01.png, 1742, 155, muttering started again , and went on and on . Stunned and 
Lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-02.png, 1709, 139, shaken , Steve drew a glass of water and went back to 
Lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-03.png, 1733, 121, Heather . Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still 
Lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-04.png, 1873, 165, trying to shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects . 
Lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-05.png, 1817, 149, For several minutes they had been facing each other across 
Lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-06.png, 1953, 140, a low table , like two old convalescents thoroughly bored with 
Lines/m01/m01-026/m01-026-07.png, 1199, 179, each other through forced association . 
Lines/m01/m01-160/m01-160-00.png, 1699, 112, After a long wait a bus appeared and they 
Lines/m01/m01-160/m01-160-01.png, 1560, 115, followed the beaming Dan aboard , taking 
Lines/m01/m01-160/m01-160-02.png, 1557, 98, seats some rows behind him . Steve was 
Lines/m01/m01-160/m01-160-03.png, 1781, 138, beginning to find the stereotyped , flattish , happy 
Lines/m01/m01-160/m01-160-04.png, 1609, 123, faces very disconcerting ; and looking at 
Lines/m01/m01-160/m01-160-05.png, 1640, 110, Heather he found a welcome relief in her 
Lines/m01/m01-160/m01-160-06.png, 1188, 125, relatively long doleful one 
Lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-00.png, 1391, 140, Deadly stillness , deadly portent ! 
Lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-01.png, 1707, 101, Steve awakened early and switched on 
Lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-02.png, 1731, 104, the radio , which he kept tuned to CBO. 
Lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-03.png, 1782, 119, The set lighted-up but gave only a low 
Lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-04.png, 1672, 121, buzzing sound . He had just finished 
Lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-05.png, 1706, 129, shaving when it came on , with a flat 
Lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-06.png, 1623, 145, voice repeating : " This is BBC calling 
Lines/m01/m01-084/m01-084-07.png, 1248, 168, ... this is BBC calling ... " 
Lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-00.png, 1573, 118, There can be little doubt that if the 
Lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-01.png, 1833, 98, Thetans discover our mental independence 
Lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-02.png, 1931, 122, they will promptly give us their hypnotic 
Lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-03.png, 1696, 110, treatment . If we can avoid undue 
Lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-04.png, 1725, 105, prominence , it may be that we can 
Lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-05.png, 1622, 143, move about pretty freely without 
Lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-06.png, 1697, 130, detection . If we can - well , then we 
Lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-07.png, 1618, 114, may be able to promote our own 
Lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-08.png, 1681, 88, interests . What those interests 
Lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-09.png, 1745, 132, are , beyond personal security , 
Lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-10.png, 1764, 144, I haven't a clue ; but , who knows , 
Lines/m01/m01-110/m01-110-11.png, 1911, 118, we may form the nucleus around ... 
Lines/m01/m01-131/m01-131-00.png, 1736, 134, When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action 
Lines/m01/m01-131/m01-131-01.png, 1675, 145, gave the impression of having been thought out and 
Lines/m01/m01-131/m01-131-02.png, 1651, 121, decided upon . Inside they sat down unbidden , while 
Lines/m01/m01-131/m01-131-03.png, 1645, 119, Dan paced the floor . He seemed completely unaware 
Lines/m01/m01-131/m01-131-04.png, 1697, 163, of their presence . They just stared at him , turning 
Lines/m01/m01-131/m01-131-05.png, 1650, 114, their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and 
Lines/m01/m01-131/m01-131-06.png, 630, 98, down , up and down . 
Lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-00.png, 1784, 108, A shudder , more mental than physical , ran 
Lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-01.png, 1669, 116, through him , and his mind seemed to 
Lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-02.png, 1725, 109, melt away into emptiness . His bulging 
Lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-03.png, 1776, 125, eyes caught the reclining form of Heather , 
Lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-04.png, 1657, 115, who was still repeating in sing-song : 
Lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-05.png, 1903, 127, " ... I will not give in ... " He stared at her 
Lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-06.png, 1760, 116, blankly , mouthing an incoherent gabble 
Lines/m01/m01-000/m01-000-07.png, 720, 108, of half words . 
Lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-00.png, 1919, 192, " They have come ! " he said reverently , gripping his 
Lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-01.png, 1906, 149, hands together between his knees and leaning 
Lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-02.png, 1957, 149, forward . " Isn't it a glorious thing ! Long awaited 
Lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-03.png, 1891, 119, transcendent event , the exalted desire of all 
Lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-04.png, 1961, 160, mankind through all ages ! The Kingdom of the 
Lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-05.png, 1909, 144, Mind is at hand ! " He turned beaming eyes 
Lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-06.png, 1917, 136, upward and shook his head slowly from 
Lines/m01/m01-060/m01-060-07.png, 696, 108, side to side . 
Lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-00.png, 1606, 191, He bumped into a floor lamp and 
Lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-01.png, 1749, 177, switched it on . Heather McNabb still lay 
Lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-02.png, 1883, 165, on the couch , her body uncomfortably twisted 
Lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-03.png, 1872, 159, and afflicted with occasional spasmodic jerks . 
Lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-04.png, 1826, 156, He went to the kitchen for water and found 
Lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-05.png, 1843, 175, Dan . Dan was lying on a long bench in the 
Lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-06.png, 1742, 158, breakfast nook , his head bent upright 
Lines/m01/m01-017/m01-017-07.png, 711, 196, against the wall . 
Lines/m01/m01-079/m01-079-00.png, 1831, 163, A superfluous precaution for there was no other car 
Lines/m01/m01-079/m01-079-01.png, 1873, 180, abroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait 
Lines/m01/m01-079/m01-079-02.png, 1726, 215, at an intersection for the light to change . At his 
Lines/m01/m01-079/m01-079-03.png, 1625, 195, apartment he garaged his car and then stood 
Lines/m01/m01-079/m01-079-04.png, 1798, 217, listening in the night . Listening in vain . For the 
Lines/m01/m01-079/m01-079-05.png, 1718, 233, earth had lost its life-tempo , as the heart 
Lines/m01/m01-079/m01-079-06.png, 973, 133, loses its beat in death . 
Lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-00.png, 1761, 128, After what seemed an undue period of repetition , the voice 
Lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-01.png, 1681, 129, went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony 
Lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-02.png, 1786, 95, in Sussex , in all its obscene details . Then the radio 
Lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-03.png, 1658, 123, went dead again , and Steve had no stomach for 
Lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-04.png, 1731, 146, breakfast . It was a beautiful day , as firsts-of-June 
Lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-05.png, 1702, 115, should be . Steve got out the car and traversed the 
Lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-06.png, 1686, 132, same empty streets as he had the night before , 
Lines/m01/m01-090/m01-090-07.png, 1389, 113, to keep an appointment with Heather . 
Lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-00.png, 1732, 90, The Thetans must not see him ! He took another route 
Lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-01.png, 1642, 137, to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on 
Lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-02.png, 1746, 134, the way . Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at 
Lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-03.png, 1799, 126, once ; but Steve insisted that they should first discuss 
Lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-04.png, 1749, 131, their situation , as far as it could be assessed , 
Lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-05.png, 1707, 92, and to decide on what seemed to be the best 
Lines/m01/m01-100/m01-100-06.png, 657, 146, way of meeting it . 
Lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-00.png, 1786, 150, " The Thetans , " he said , " are presumably here to 
Lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-01.png, 1654, 172, take charge , as it were , of the minds of the 
Lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-02.png, 1845, 178, people - who are probably falling all over them- 
Lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-03.png, 1873, 166, selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry 
Lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-04.png, 1953, 171, them out . Just what these orders will be , we don't 
Lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-05.png, 2005, 167, know . Now , because of prior hypnosis we have es- 
Lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-06.png, 1860, 183, caped Thetan subjugation . This time . But we no 
Lines/m01/m01-104/m01-104-07.png, 1118, 173, longer have any immunity . 
Lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-00.png, 1621, 106, " Now , to summarize what I think our 
Lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-01.png, 1814, 155, course of action should be . First , to avoid the 
Lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-02.png, 1862, 176, Thetans like the plague , for they must not 
Lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-03.png, 1907, 144, find us out ! Second , to tread pretty warily 
Lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-04.png, 1954, 152, among our own people , finding out just how 
Lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-05.png, 1957, 176, much freedom we can take with safety . 
Lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-06.png, 2012, 150, And third , to study these damned Thetans . 
Lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-07.png, 1829, 116, We must learn all we can about 
Lines/m01/m01-115/m01-115-08.png, 357, 73, them . 
Lines/d07/d07-096/d07-096-00.png, 1773, 139, Or it is possible that our sugya contains the 
Lines/d07/d07-096/d07-096-01.png, 1800, 138, original question and answer and this is quoted 
Lines/d07/d07-096/d07-096-02.png, 1817, 137, in the other sugya . ( This can be supported by the 
Lines/d07/d07-096/d07-096-03.png, 1808, 133, use of the expression : ' Boaz did it of his own 
Lines/d07/d07-096/d07-096-04.png, 1788, 142, accord but there was no approval of his action 
Lines/d07/d07-096/d07-096-05.png, 1536, 128, in Heaven ' in both sugyoth . Such an 
Lines/d07/d07-096/d07-096-06.png, 1661, 150, expression appears to have been framed in 
Lines/d07/d07-096/d07-096-07.png, 1631, 143, response to the particular point at issue here , 
Lines/d07/d07-096/d07-096-08.png, 1583, 126, whether the Heavenly Court concurred 
Lines/d07/d07-096/d07-096-09.png, 1765, 160, in the decision of the human court . ) 
Lines/d07/d07-102/d07-102-00.png, 1765, 143, The Gemara continues with a saying of the 
Lines/d07/d07-102/d07-102-01.png, 1781, 131, Palestinian teacher , R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent. ) : 
Lines/d07/d07-102/d07-102-02.png, 1869, 132, ' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places : 
Lines/d07/d07-102/d07-102-03.png, 1915, 128, the court of Shem , the court of Samuel of Ramah , 
Lines/d07/d07-102/d07-102-04.png, 1810, 150, and the court of Solomon . ' The place of this 
Lines/d07/d07-102/d07-102-05.png, 1767, 151, saying here is obvious , it follows naturally 
Lines/d07/d07-102/d07-102-06.png, 1800, 158, on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which 
Lines/d07/d07-102/d07-102-07.png, 1263, 93, deals with a similar theme . 
Lines/d07/d07-089/d07-089-00.png, 1736, 133, ( This is probably to be understood as a well- 
Lines/d07/d07-089/d07-089-01.png, 1767, 138, known comment on the verse ; quoted by 
Lines/d07/d07-089/d07-089-02.png, 1751, 147, Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted 
Lines/d07/d07-089/d07-089-03.png, 1694, 153, by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b. 
Lines/d07/d07-089/d07-089-04.png, 1749, 195, Levi's thesis ! ) The proof text of greeting by 
Lines/d07/d07-089/d07-089-05.png, 1797, 119, the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah . 
Lines/d07/d07-089/d07-089-06.png, 1767, 100, There is no reference to the Mishnah here 
Lines/d07/d07-089/d07-089-07.png, 1738, 105, because the Mishnah deals with the 
Lines/d07/d07-089/d07-089-08.png, 1828, 191, actual practice of greeting by the divine 
Lines/d07/d07-089/d07-089-09.png, 1818, 158, Name and the Gemara here quotes the 
Lines/d07/d07-089/d07-089-10.png, 1888, 165, texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi . 
Lines/d07/d07-085/d07-085-00.png, 1827, 153, From the above it follows that here , once again , 
Lines/d07/d07-085/d07-085-01.png, 1630, 147, we have a good illustration of how a 
Lines/d07/d07-085/d07-085-02.png, 1752, 159, sugya has been fashioned from material 
Lines/d07/d07-085/d07-085-03.png, 1695, 143, already in the hands of the Redactors . 
Lines/d07/d07-085/d07-085-04.png, 1775, 151, The sugya is built around the saying of 
Lines/d07/d07-085/d07-085-05.png, 1638, 144, R. Joshua b. Levi . The proof text for the 
Lines/d07/d07-085/d07-085-06.png, 1727, 133, reading of the Book of Esther is quoted 
Lines/d07/d07-085/d07-085-07.png, 1609, 142, with the comment given by Samuel .

Lines/d07/d07-100/d07-100-05.png, 1627, 135, a familiar interpretation which had 
Lines/d07/d07-100/d07-100-06.png, 1592, 90, become so well known that it was 
Lines/d07/d07-100/d07-100-07.png, 1650, 114, invariably quoted whenever the verse 
Lines/d07/d07-100/d07-100-08.png, 1719, 139, itself was quoted , almost as if it were a

Lines/d07/d07-082/d07-082-02.png, 1907, 119, too , are necessary , but a careful examination 
Lines/d07/d07-082/d07-082-03.png, 1837, 156, of that passage makes it clear that these are

Lines/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-04.png, 1941, 158, knew perfectly well that Byron , as early 
Lines/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-05.png, 1967, 116, as the year of their wedding , 1815 , had 
Lines/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-06.png, 2060, 130, made a will in Augusta's favour , she had 
Lines/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-07.png, 2046, 148, evidently not passed on that information ; 
Lines/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-08.png, 2029, 137, and it came as an appalling surprise to 
Lines/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-09.png, 1917, 119, Captain Byron that he had been left 
Lines/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-10.png, 2035, 169, without the fortune that would keep up the

Lines/g07/g07-022b/g07-022b-00.png, 1787, 122, Augusta Leigh too was favourably impressed , and wrote 
Lines/g07/g07-022b/g07-022b-01.png, 1765, 128, to Lady Byron after she had received a visit from

Lines/g07/g07-014b/g07-014b-01.png, 1844, 97, days before Trelawny appeared , Gamba wrote to Lord Sidney Osborne , 
Lines/g07/g07-014b/g07-014b-02.png, 1824, 97, and his inventory has been preserved . The papers were reopened in

Lines/g07/g07-014b/g07-014b-04.png, 1144, 86, sure that no recent will was amongst them . 
Lines/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-00.png, 1737, 116, There were few things in Augusta's whole 
Lines/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-01.png, 1780, 114, life , full of calamities though it was , that 
Lines/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-02.png, 1808, 117, hurt her more than this contemptuous slight 
Lines/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-03.png, 1747, 117, from George Anson Byron , whom she had 
Lines/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-04.png, 1910, 130, loved with an unswerving loyalty , and had looked 
Lines/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-05.png, 1782, 100, on as her intimate friend . Moreover , he 
Lines/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-06.png, 1588, 116, was without the right to make such 
Lines/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-07.png, 1883, 129, pronouncements : he had inherited nothing 
Lines/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-08.png, 1867, 119, from her brother but his title , whereas 
Lines/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-09.png, 1798, 122, she was not only of nearer consanguinity 
Lines/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-10.png, 1850, 122, but the chosen recipient of his property . 
Lines/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-00.png, 1703, 166, When he saw Trelawny's printed letter , Lord Sidney wrote 
Lines/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-01.png, 1517, 164, to Douglas Kinnaird saying that it was incorrect 
Lines/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-02.png, 1722, 149, throughout . He had no sooner heard from Count Gamba 
Lines/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-03.png, 1592, 153, and Fletcher that Byron would have wished his 
Lines/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-04.png, 1479, 153, body to return to England than that course was 
Lines/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-05.png, 1720, 157, ' immediately carried into effect ' - not in spite of himself 
Lines/g07/g07-000b/g07-000b-06.png, 1624, 160, and Sir Frederick Stoven , but with their perfect con-

Lines/g07/g07-038/g07-038-00.png, 1742, 100, She felt almost as strongly as Hobhouse 
Lines/g07/g07-038/g07-038-01.png, 1777, 131, # about biographies . Quite apart from the 
Lines/g07/g07-038/g07-038-02.png, 1751, 97, divagations of her ' poor brother ' - so she 
Lines/g07/g07-038/g07-038-03.png, 1773, 106, constantly referred to him - there were a 
Lines/g07/g07-038/g07-038-04.png, 1483, 108, hundred reasons why it would be 
Lines/g07/g07-038/g07-038-05.png, 1645, 118, objectionable to have the family history 
Lines/g07/g07-038/g07-038-06.png, 1800, 97, exposed . Whatever latitude she allowed in 
Lines/g07/g07-038/g07-038-07.png, 1938, 129, the warmth of her kindly nature to others - 
Lines/g07/g07-038/g07-038-08.png, 1818, 117, or to herself - she believed implicitly in 
Lines/g07/g07-038/g07-038-09.png, 1739, 94, the moral code she had learned from 
Lines/g07/g07-038/g07-038-10.png, 1770, 109, her good grandmother , the Countess of 
Lines/g07/g07-014/g07-014-00.png, 1933, 106, I have taken an exact inventory of them . ' 
Lines/g07/g07-014/g07-014-01.png, 1669, 105, Thus on April 21st , several days before 
Lines/g07/g07-014/g07-014-02.png, 1854, 101, Trelawny appeared , Gamba wrote to Lord 
Lines/g07/g07-014/g07-014-03.png, 2035, 99, Sidney Osborne , and his inventory has been 
Lines/g07/g07-014/g07-014-04.png, 2033, 99, preserved . The papers were reopened in the 
Lines/g07/g07-014/g07-014-05.png, 1961, 87, presence of leading Missolonghi officials 
Lines/g07/g07-014/g07-014-06.png, 1985, 76, in order to make sure that no recent will 
Lines/g07/g07-014/g07-014-07.png, 936, 77, was amongst them . 
Lines/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-00.png, 1972, 116, Augusta Leigh too was favourably impressed , 
Lines/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-01.png, 1778, 99, and wrote to Lady Byron after she had 
Lines/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-02.png, 2024, 93, received a visit from him : I have today seen 
Lines/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-03.png, 1932, 98, Count Gamba - which was very distressing 
Lines/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-04.png, 2055, 97, for many reasons but quite unavoidable - he 
Lines/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-05.png, 1864, 104, is a pleasing , fine looking young man & 
Lines/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-06.png, 1864, 107, spoke with great feeling . The unfortunate 
Lines/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-07.png, 1927, 103, Augusta was in one of her worst states of 
Lines/g07/g07-022a/g07-022a-08.png, 447, 93, confusion . 
Lines/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-00.png, 1706, 107, In his popular and acutely unreliable book on Byron and 
Lines/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-01.png, 1671, 116, Shelley , Trelawny implies that not only Gamba but Fletcher 
Lines/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-02.png, 1807, 95, and Tita and the steward , Lega Zambelli , failed to perform 
Lines/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-03.png, 1779, 107, the most elementary duties towards the dead . He pretends 
Lines/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-04.png, 1839, 123, to have found everything in uttermost disorder - ' tokens that 
Lines/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-05.png, 1714, 86, the Pilgrim had most treasured , scattered on the floor , - 
Lines/g07/g07-007b/g07-007b-06.png, 1691, 77, as rubbish of no marketable value , and trampled on ' . 
Lines/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-00.png, 1724, 131, She had loved Byron , but she had betrayed him , 
Lines/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-01.png, 1837, 155, betrayed him not twice , as he had betrayed her , 
Lines/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-02.png, 1598, 145, but again and again over a long span of time , 
Lines/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-03.png, 1792, 145, fawning on his implacable wife , purveying to her 
Lines/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-04.png, 1588, 128, in secret the unguarded letters he never 
Lines/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-05.png, 1623, 136, suspected any eye but her own would see , 
Lines/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-06.png, 1731, 148, feeding the stealthy fires of her animosity : 
Lines/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-07.png, 1714, 138, and having betrayed him , she had grown to 
Lines/g07/g07-026b/g07-026b-08.png, 1273, 106, fear and almost to hate him . 
Lines/g07/g07-042/g07-042-00.png, 1653, 87, She had no desire to see in print that her 
Lines/g07/g07-042/g07-042-01.png, 1754, 75, mother , who was to have been a duchess , had 
Lines/g07/g07-042/g07-042-02.png, 1635, 64, been involved in a scandalous and ruinous 
Lines/g07/g07-042/g07-042-03.png, 1742, 105, divorce , that her father , ' Mad Jack Byron ' , was 
Lines/g07/g07-042/g07-042-04.png, 1418, 99, a profligate and a bankrupt who had 
Lines/g07/g07-042/g07-042-05.png, 1677, 106, squandered every penny two successive wives 
Lines/g07/g07-042/g07-042-06.png, 1712, 85, had brought him and left the second on 
Lines/g07/g07-042/g07-042-07.png, 1819, 94, the verge of destitution , and that he had died 
Lines/g07/g07-042/g07-042-08.png, 1716, 100, a drunkard and perhaps a suicide , hiding 
Lines/g07/g07-042/g07-042-09.png, 1305, 94, in France to escape his creditors . 
Lines/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-00.png, 1608, 98, She had loved Byron , but she had 
Lines/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-01.png, 1887, 97, betrayed him , betrayed him not twice , as 
Lines/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-02.png, 1905, 98, he had betrayed her , but again and again 
Lines/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-03.png, 1912, 92, over a long span of time , fawning on his 
Lines/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-04.png, 2030, 91, implacable wife , purveying to her in secret 
Lines/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-05.png, 1928, 83, the unguarded letters he never suspected 
Lines/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-06.png, 1910, 95, any eye but her own would see , feeding 
Lines/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-07.png, 1847, 105, the stealthy fires of her animosity : and 
Lines/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-08.png, 2040, 93, having betrayed him , she had grown to fear 
Lines/g07/g07-026a/g07-026a-09.png, 1165, 83, and almost to hate him . 
Lines/g07/g07-030/g07-030-00.png, 1588, 121, She had dreaded still more that he might 
Lines/g07/g07-030/g07-030-01.png, 1602, 129, return to England , overshadowing her again 
Lines/g07/g07-030/g07-030-02.png, 1788, 109, with spiritual and social peril . But this kind 
Lines/g07/g07-030/g07-030-03.png, 1642, 132, of return was what she could never have 
Lines/g07/g07-030/g07-030-04.png, 1787, 121, foreseen ... that he # should come back not 
Lines/g07/g07-030/g07-030-05.png, 1814, 101, voluble but silent , not beautiful but defaced , 
Lines/g07/g07-030/g07-030-06.png, 1736, 147, not in obloquy but with his praises ringing ! 
Lines/g07/g07-030/g07-030-07.png, 1799, 136, She could remember now his exciting laughter , 
Lines/g07/g07-030/g07-030-08.png, 1661, 95, his almost filial love for her , her almost 
Lines/g07/g07-030/g07-030-09.png, 846, 88, maternal love for him . 
Lines/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-00.png, 1944, 95, She had dreaded his outpourings of affection 
Lines/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-01.png, 1905, 94, for her in poetry that he thought would clear 
Lines/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-02.png, 1854, 91, her and that only compromised her , and the 
Lines/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-03.png, 1954, 81, headstrong folly that tempted him to write on 
Lines/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-04.png, 1949, 97, ever more daring themes , teaching the world 
Lines/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-05.png, 2013, 88, to guess what repentance and unrepentance 
Lines/g07/g07-028a/g07-028a-06.png, 1121, 84, preyed upon his thoughts . 
Lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-00.png, 1601, 110, These , if she had only known it , were 
Lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-01.png, 1817, 115, precisely the reasons why her cousin took 
Lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-02.png, 1802, 132, pleasure in the opportunity of annoying her . 
Lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-03.png, 1839, 111, Lady Byron did not like Augusta to have 
Lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-04.png, 1890, 122, intimate friends , and in every instance where 
Lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-05.png, 1841, 115, the occasion was granted her , she managed 
Lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-06.png, 1925, 115, to find some excuse for bestowing , in whole 
Lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-07.png, 1834, 105, or in part , those confidences which never 
Lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-08.png, 1842, 113, failed to leave her audience agape with 
Lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-09.png, 1867, 124, wonder at her magnanimity and Augusta's 
Lines/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-10.png, 470, 67, wickedness . 
Lines/g07/g07-050/g07-050-00.png, 1581, 106, She was most emphatically opposed to the 
Lines/g07/g07-050/g07-050-01.png, 1744, 101, production of sheer indelicacies , and that was 
Lines/g07/g07-050/g07-050-02.png, 1762, 98, the light in which she saw the proposed book 
Lines/g07/g07-050/g07-050-03.png, 1801, 116, by Dallas . Letters between a mother and a son - 
Lines/g07/g07-050/g07-050-04.png, 1791, 102, a son so outspoken and a mother so far from 
Lines/g07/g07-050/g07-050-05.png, 1631, 111, suitable to be paraded before the public ! 
Lines/g07/g07-050/g07-050-06.png, 1843, 106, And brought out by that seedy poor relation , 
Lines/g07/g07-050/g07-050-07.png, 1757, 115, Dallas ! Could anything be in worse taste ? 
Lines/g07/g07-047/g07-047-00.png, 1810, 106, She had earned the right to be left in peace . 
Lines/g07/g07-047/g07-047-01.png, 1844, 96, Byron's fame was , of course , very wonderful , but 
Lines/g07/g07-047/g07-047-02.png, 1760, 109, it carried with it too many reminders of his 
Lines/g07/g07-047/g07-047-03.png, 1820, 108, terrible indiscretions - the writing of Don Juan , 
Lines/g07/g07-047/g07-047-04.png, 1625, 85, which she had never ceased to deplore , his 
Lines/g07/g07-047/g07-047-05.png, 1885, 108, shocking blasphemies like the Vision of Judgement , 
Lines/g07/g07-047/g07-047-06.png, 1782, 109, his making friends with the atheist known to 
Lines/g07/g07-047/g07-047-07.png, 1672, 120, her as ' that infamous Mr. Shelley ' , and his 
Lines/g07/g07-047/g07-047-08.png, 1767, 105, mixing with really low and horrid people such 
Lines/g07/g07-047/g07-047-09.png, 1774, 116, as the subversive journalist Leigh Hunt , whom 
Lines/g07/g07-047/g07-047-10.png, 1882, 119, on would never conceivably meet in decent society . 
Lines/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-00.png, 1949, 117, It may have been then that Trelawny contrived to do 
Lines/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-01.png, 1962, 81, his copying . Considering that Pietro was not above 
Lines/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-02.png, 2020, 78, twenty-three years of age when he undertook a load 
Lines/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-03.png, 1993, 77, of heavy responsibilities , his conduct reveals him as 
Lines/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-04.png, 1750, 76, one of the most intelligent as well as the most 
Lines/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-05.png, 1963, 92, sympathetic of Byron's 6entourage in Greece . With 
Lines/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-06.png, 2061, 91, his good looks - for he ' carried the passport of a very 
Lines/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-07.png, 2070, 97, handsome person ' - his good manners and his perfect 
Lines/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-08.png, 2031, 95, lack of pretension , he even succeeded in disarming 
Lines/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-09.png, 2086, 99, Hobhouse's possessiveness and making him forget how 
Lines/g07/g07-018a/g07-018a-10.png, 1998, 95, deeply he had disapproved , less than two years 
Lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-00.png, 1931, 149, The Hall proved most useful , especially in winter 
Lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-01.png, 1970, 182, when the distance to the church deterred many from 
Lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-02.png, 1978, 176, coming to Sunday Evensong . We managed to furnish 
Lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-03.png, 1752, 122, a table with cross and candles , and the people 
Lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-04.png, 1932, 164, appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well 
Lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-05.png, 1983, 142, as for more secular purposes . In 1910 Dr. Talbot 
Lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-06.png, 1810, 108, was translated to Winchester , and Dr. Hubert 
Lines/g04/g04-007/g04-007-07.png, 1409, 164, Burge became Bishop of Southwark . 
Lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-00.png, 1724, 90, Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much 
Lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-01.png, 1873, 108, co-operation especially with the other Christian communities . 
Lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-02.png, 1919, 111, At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the 
Lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-03.png, 1987, 115, ' Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund ' in whose counsels and committees 
Lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-04.png, 1969, 115, I found myself deeply involved . At first , the main work was to help 
Lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-05.png, 1820, 121, wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation ' 
Lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-06.png, 1838, 111, allowances , but soon , alas ! , as casualties began and increased 
Lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-07.png, 1865, 113, in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions 
Lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-08.png, 1807, 134, became very urgent , and I was asked to be Chairman 
Lines/g04/g04-068/g04-068-09.png, 1389, 130, of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley . 
Lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-00.png, 1832, 125, My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with 
Lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-01.png, 1737, 125, his family , and found a very suitable house nearby 
Lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-02.png, 1823, 119, where my mother settled , and eventually died in 1926 
Lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-03.png, 1838, 128, at the age of 92 . Dr. Burge was not able to be present 
Lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-04.png, 1857, 85, at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's . 
Lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-05.png, 1852, 138, This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich , 
Lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-06.png, 1758, 115, Dr. John Leake , who lived at Blackheath , and was 
Lines/g04/g04-039/g04-039-07.png, 812, 94, a close friend of ours . 
Lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-00.png, 1860, 118, It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling 
Lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-01.png, 1832, 101, such a beautiful building with suitable fittings ; I made 
Lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-02.png, 1827, 98, a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to 
Lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-03.png, 1982, 116, the architect , himself a fine artist . It is quite possible 
Lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-04.png, 1822, 109, to put beautiful things into a beautiful church 
Lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-05.png, 1861, 131, and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui- 
Lines/g04/g04-052/g04-052-06.png, 846, 81, table to the environs . 
Lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-00.png, 1862, 191, After the First World War , 1914 , I did not visit 
Lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-01.png, 1787, 165, Germany for ten years , by which time in 
Lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-02.png, 1806, 141, 1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey . 
Lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-03.png, 1866, 152, Towards the end of my five and a half years' 
Lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-04.png, 1798, 141, incumbency I was asked if I would start 
Lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-05.png, 1756, 177, a village choral society and conduct it . 
Lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-06.png, 1844, 168, This opened up a new interest , and we plunged 
Lines/g04/g04-022/g04-022-07.png, 276, 115, into it . 
Lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-00.png, 1884, 116, IN 1913 Dr. Burge , Bishop of Southwark , asked me to go as 
Lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-01.png, 1779, 114, Vicar of St. Mark's , Woodcote , Purley , a new church built 
Lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-02.png, 1856, 126, by the well-known architect Mr. George Fellowes Prynne , 
Lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-03.png, 1755, 126, who was to become a very intimate friend , and I was 
Lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-04.png, 1665, 135, later on joint executor of his estate with his 
Lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-05.png, 1811, 112, solicitor cousin . As Bishop Talbot had told me that I 
Lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-06.png, 1826, 118, ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield , we held 
Lines/g04/g04-036/g04-036-07.png, 916, 128, great family consultations . 
Lines/g04/g04-104/g04-104-00.png, 1689, 129, In those early years 1914-18 , life was very full 
Lines/g04/g04-104/g04-104-01.png, 1664, 89, both in the parish and in the wider war activities . 
Lines/g04/g04-104/g04-104-02.png, 1618, 128, The Bishop , knowing that I spent my holidays in 
Lines/g04/g04-104/g04-104-03.png, 1787, 102, Bavaria , asked me if I would do something for two wards 
Lines/g04/g04-104/g04-104-04.png, 1711, 92, at the Royal Herbert Hospital , full of war prisoners . 
Lines/g04/g04-104/g04-104-05.png, 1797, 118, I was very glad to help in this way , and visited them 
Lines/g04/g04-104/g04-104-06.png, 1787, 106, frequently , establishing at once a friendly contact with 
Lines/g04/g04-104/g04-104-07.png, 1650, 81, the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find 
Lines/g04/g04-104/g04-104-08.png, 1329, 87, someone who knew their native villages . 
Lines/g04/g04-032/g04-032-00.png, 1592, 182, Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's ' Hiawatha's 
Lines/g04/g04-032/g04-032-01.png, 1739, 140, Wedding Feast . ' Enthusiasm grew , and in a few more months we 
Lines/g04/g04-032/g04-032-02.png, 1785, 127, gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster , 
Lines/g04/g04-032/g04-032-03.png, 1669, 129, and the tenor solo ' Onaway awake ' was sung by the Rector . 
Lines/g04/g04-032/g04-032-04.png, 1750, 144, Friends from Limpsfield , in addition to the villagers , came up , 
Lines/g04/g04-032/g04-032-05.png, 667, 127, and we were all happy . 
Lines/g04/g04-098/g04-098-00.png, 1845, 119, From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very 
Lines/g04/g04-098/g04-098-01.png, 1925, 131, deep friendship which I have taken with me through 
Lines/g04/g04-098/g04-098-02.png, 1883, 153, all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry . Mr. and 
Lines/g04/g04-098/g04-098-03.png, 1802, 131, Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult 
Lines/g04/g04-098/g04-098-04.png, 1766, 166, years of war , when most lives were upset and 
Lines/g04/g04-098/g04-098-05.png, 1724, 157, some tempers were easily frayed , the most 
Lines/g04/g04-098/g04-098-06.png, 1085, 164, loyal and devoted friends . 
Lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-00.png, 1842, 150, It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau 
Lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-01.png, 1809, 143, in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play . The place and its people were 
Lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-02.png, 1766, 137, to play an important part in my life . For five years in succession till 
Lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-03.png, 1827, 139, war broke out in 1914 , I spent my summer holidays there and became 
Lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-04.png, 1820, 118, very intimate with the people and the environs . Every year between the 
Lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-05.png, 1671, 140, Passion Plays , an interval of ten years , another play would be 
Lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-06.png, 1794, 126, performed at the small theatre in the village , when new talent would 
Lines/g04/g04-017/g04-017-07.png, 711, 98, be discovered and trained . 
Lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-00.png, 1792, 99, The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the 
Lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-01.png, 1686, 77, Lansdowne Road district , but I needed more help in the 
Lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-02.png, 1896, 81, church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays . 
Lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-03.png, 1866, 100, Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. E. U. Evitt in 
Lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-04.png, 1798, 93, 1913 soon after I had come , and he organized the Mission 
Lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-05.png, 1799, 107, district and got to know , and be known by , many of 
Lines/g04/g04-060/g04-060-06.png, 906, 85, the people of the parish . 
Lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-00.png, 1631, 167, Dr. Davidson said he would go for 
Lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-01.png, 1814, 155, a walk over the fields while we attended 
Lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-02.png, 1636, 157, to our business . To my amusement , 
Lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-03.png, 1663, 152, when we met at tea at the rectory 
Lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-04.png, 1630, 167, after the Dedication , the Archbishop 
Lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-05.png, 1520, 125, said he had been stopped by 
Lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-06.png, 1623, 167, a farmer in a field . He seemed 
Lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-07.png, 1681, 136, rather indignant , but we took the 
Lines/g04/g04-003/g04-003-08.png, 1723, 143, episode without a smile till afterwards . 
Lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-00.png, 1764, 196, First of all simple part-songs : I found only one member who had 
Lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-01.png, 1799, 149, any idea of reading music . This was the village doctor who was an 
Lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-02.png, 1790, 128, old school friend at Clifton . He could sustain the tenor part quite well 
Lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-03.png, 1747, 135, and lead the others . As for basses and altos the conductor had to 
Lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-04.png, 1836, 147, teach by singing the parts with them . It was very amusing , and by 
Lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-05.png, 1765, 140, the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women 
Lines/g04/g04-026/g04-026-06.png, 1286, 127, could render simple part-singing tolerably well . 
Lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-00.png, 1845, 97, Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers 
Lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-01.png, 1876, 89, were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen . Life was 
Lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-02.png, 1859, 82, in those years more than busy . We now had a vicarage next 
Lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-03.png, 1861, 89, to the church , and I was most fortunate in having for eight 
Lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-04.png, 1875, 95, years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known 
Lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-05.png, 1833, 79, well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the 
Lines/g04/g04-077/g04-077-06.png, 237, 62, church . 
Lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-00.png, 1778, 192, Speaking of churchwardens and children leads 
Lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-01.png, 1726, 91, me at once to chronicle a most intimate and 
Lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-02.png, 1728, 168, lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and 
Lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-03.png, 1792, 156, continuing till old age to-day . When I went 
Lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-04.png, 1820, 143, to St. Mark's , the first contact I made was 
Lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-05.png, 1785, 104, with the Vicar's Warden , Mr. F. W. Charlton 
Lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-06.png, 1788, 257, and his family , the youngest of whose three 
Lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-07.png, 1840, 152, sons was just coming into the world in this year 
Lines/g04/g04-095/g04-095-08.png, 344, 148, of 1913 . 
Lines/g04/g04-014/g04-014-00.png, 1736, 117, There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in 
Lines/g04/g04-014/g04-014-01.png, 1794, 154, some quarters , until I explained that my church 
Lines/g04/g04-014/g04-014-02.png, 1785, 195, was 800 feet high above the sea level ! The 
Lines/g04/g04-014/g04-014-03.png, 1798, 148, work was growing pretty heavy , and we managed 
Lines/g04/g04-014/g04-014-04.png, 1730, 181, to get a stipendiary layman who could help 
Lines/g04/g04-014/g04-014-05.png, 1404, 156, among the children and young people . 
Lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-00.png, 1693, 83, I suggested to the congregation that it needed 
Lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-01.png, 1815, 86, warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we 
Lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-02.png, 1693, 87, found many to help . Gifts of candlesticks and 
Lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-03.png, 1789, 84, stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar - 
Lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-04.png, 1852, 96, helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary 
Lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-05.png, 1806, 93, for prayer and quiet . In time we received similar 
Lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-06.png, 1700, 99, gifts for the High Altar , and large East and West 
Lines/g04/g04-048/g04-048-07.png, 271, 50, windows . 
Lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-00.png, 1829, 78, But what a change from the dear little old church 
Lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-01.png, 1892, 86, at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's 
Lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-02.png, 1833, 98, at Purley . One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the 
Lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-03.png, 1857, 78, church was , it had its own atmosphere , and for centuries 
Lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-04.png, 1900, 108, had been a House of Prayer . I could not but feel the 
Lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-05.png, 1899, 77, chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is . 
Lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-06.png, 1796, 116, When we had found a group of people who gladly 
Lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-07.png, 1826, 83, co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place 
Lines/g04/g04-043/g04-043-08.png, 629, 94, of daily prayer . 
Lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-00.png, 1784, 112, A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following 
Lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-01.png, 1811, 100, year , 1914 , when war broke out . Very soon Chaplains for 
Lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-02.png, 1830, 97, the Forces were urgently needed , and I felt clearly 
Lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-03.png, 1824, 99, that one of us must volunteer . The Bishop , Dr. Burge , did 
Lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-04.png, 1869, 102, not wish me to go then , as I had barely been in the parish 
Lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-05.png, 1868, 103, for a year . Mr. Evitt , however , was much less committed 
Lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-06.png, 1798, 78, than his Vicar , and he was accepted at once and 
Lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-07.png, 1692, 104, was very soon in France where he did splendid 
Lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-08.png, 1865, 59, work until his health broke down and he had a bad 
Lines/g04/g04-063/g04-063-09.png, 887, 64, attack of enteric fever . 
Lines/g04/g04-081/g04-081-00.png, 1702, 80, On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to 
Lines/g04/g04-081/g04-081-01.png, 1779, 94, Purley she offered to come and look after me . She was 
Lines/g04/g04-081/g04-081-02.png, 1747, 66, a real treasure , of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic 
Lines/g04/g04-081/g04-081-03.png, 1726, 89, things , a widow who knew how to look after the ' boy , ' 
Lines/g04/g04-081/g04-081-04.png, 1712, 98, who was the only other occupant of the house when 
Lines/g04/g04-081/g04-081-05.png, 644, 66, Mr. Evitt had gone . 
Lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-00.png, 1727, 158, Indeed , for the next seventeen years , during my time at 
Lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-01.png, 1652, 163, Purley , and from 1922 at Surbiton , I was continuously 
Lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-02.png, 1747, 125, Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee . This 
Lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-03.png, 1813, 117, task involved a very great deal of detailed work for 
Lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-04.png, 1889, 153, the Committee . We had a splendid body of local residents , 
Lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-05.png, 1748, 148, and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries . Our 
Lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-06.png, 1696, 167, Committee met once a week in the evenings , and 
Lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-07.png, 1652, 123, included professional men from every walk of 
Lines/g04/g04-072/g04-072-08.png, 150, 89, life . 
Lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-00.png, 1807, 85, It was quite amusing to see how much 
Lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-01.png, 1857, 76, the children enjoyed the service , and I heard 
Lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-02.png, 1822, 66, of parents or faithful nurses threaten any 
Lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-03.png, 1793, 86, naughty child with the penalty of not being 
Lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-04.png, 1785, 86, allowed to come to the Children's Church 
Lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-05.png, 1839, 100, on Sunday afternoon . I hope the threat 
Lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-06.png, 1843, 76, kept them good in the week , but anyway 
Lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-07.png, 1761, 96, they were a most delightful lot , and 
Lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-08.png, 1658, 63, it is a great joy to meet them now 
Lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-09.png, 1644, 74, fifty years afterwards when so many 
Lines/g04/g04-092/g04-092-10.png, 1236, 66, are parents or even grandparents 
Lines/g04/g04-101/g04-101-00.png, 1719, 158, Their homes - for since those years they have 
Lines/g04/g04-101/g04-101-01.png, 1585, 170, lived on in Purley - have always been 
Lines/g04/g04-101/g04-101-02.png, 1735, 131, havens of rest , and the welcome has never 
Lines/g04/g04-101/g04-101-03.png, 1817, 169, failed . Their three boys , now successful men , 
Lines/g04/g04-101/g04-101-04.png, 1692, 165, were in our Children's Church from the 
Lines/g04/g04-101/g04-101-05.png, 1541, 119, outset , and when we don't see one 
Lines/g04/g04-101/g04-101-06.png, 1107, 172, another we do not forget . 
Lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-00.png, 1813, 132, We also had a little Mission Hall leading off 
Lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-01.png, 1916, 136, the Brighton Road , in a street full of small houses . 
Lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-02.png, 1821, 82, This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went 
Lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-03.png, 1873, 139, there , but was soon changed into the better- 
Lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-04.png, 1896, 119, sounding name of Lansdowne Road . There 
Lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-05.png, 1708, 117, were lots of children there , and we had 
Lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-06.png, 1796, 146, a flourishing Sunday School and an evening 
Lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-07.png, 1902, 102, service . I soon saw that the parish needed 
Lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-08.png, 1844, 121, more help both at the church and Mission 
Lines/g04/g04-055/g04-055-09.png, 342, 93, district . 
Lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-00.png, 1823, 85, We gathered together a splendid Sunday 
Lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-01.png, 1779, 89, afternoon service at the church , each child 
Lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-02.png, 1854, 97, being given a number which , as they came into 
Lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-03.png, 1769, 84, church , they could just whisper to 
Lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-04.png, 1886, 80, the superintendent who filled in the regi- 
Lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-05.png, 1746, 67, ster at her own home . Each child had a 
Lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-06.png, 1706, 71, picture given them and the lesson was 
Lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-07.png, 1650, 96, largely based on this . It was on a 
Lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-08.png, 1638, 80, stamp which could be stuck in 
Lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-09.png, 1610, 75, their book , and there was quite a 
Lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-10.png, 1603, 76, clamour for back stamps if a child 
Lines/g04/g04-088/g04-088-11.png, 1859, 59, had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause 
Lines/g04/g04-108/g04-108-00.png, 1557, 109, I could at once notice the great antagonism 
Lines/g04/g04-108/g04-108-01.png, 1806, 106, between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly 
Lines/g04/g04-108/g04-108-02.png, 1349, 94, scorned these more simple country folk . 
Lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-00.png, 1804, 152, Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan 
Lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-01.png, 1846, 163, work in connection with Higher Religious Education , and 
Lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-02.png, 1935, 157, to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading 
Lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-03.png, 1868, 179, Union . This meant organizing lectures and courses of 
Lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-04.png, 1790, 162, religious instruction through the Diocese , and I 
Lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-05.png, 1719, 167, also found myself a member of the Diocesan 
Lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-06.png, 1841, 141, Conference , where I remember introducing myself as 
Lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-07.png, 1770, 168, the incumbent of the highest church in the 
Lines/g04/g04-011/g04-011-08.png, 345, 50, Diocese . 
Lines/j01/j01-070/j01-070-00.png, 1774, 191, This resulted in the oxidation of the 
Lines/j01/j01-070/j01-070-01.png, 1887, 132, -ve electrode and reduction of the +ve 
Lines/j01/j01-070/j01-070-02.png, 1827, 141, electrode which of course led to a loss in 
Lines/j01/j01-070/j01-070-03.png, 2048, 122, E.M.F. from the cell . In the above design the two 
Lines/j01/j01-070/j01-070-04.png, 1996, 143, electrodes are completely separated from one 
Lines/j01/j01-070/j01-070-05.png, 1761, 148, another so that this major source of 
Lines/j01/j01-070/j01-070-06.png, 1510, 116, trouble should not be present . 
Lines/j01/j01-042/j01-042-00.png, 1645, 91, Unless it is known at what oxygen potential a given 
Lines/j01/j01-042/j01-042-01.png, 1668, 55, material in the sodium coolant circuit will start to 
Lines/j01/j01-042/j01-042-02.png, 1588, 78, oxidise the cell can only be used as has been 
Lines/j01/j01-042/j01-042-03.png, 1714, 89, suggested above , as an oxygen concentration monitor . 
Lines/j01/j01-042/j01-042-04.png, 1763, 87, However , if a material oxidizes in sodium at a given 
Lines/j01/j01-042/j01-042-05.png, 1813, 89, oxygen potential the reference electrode could be held 
Lines/j01/j01-042/j01-042-06.png, 1867, 97, at that potential and oxidizing or reducing conditions 
Lines/j01/j01-042/j01-042-07.png, 1793, 72, in the coolant circuit for that material would be 
Lines/j01/j01-042/j01-042-08.png, 1756, 91, indicated by a negative or positive potential at the 
Lines/j01/j01-042/j01-042-09.png, 548, 87, reference electrode . 
Lines/j01/j01-045/j01-045-00.png, 1671, 93, Thus for the specific case of niobium in a sodium 
Lines/j01/j01-045/j01-045-01.png, 1645, 74, circuit a corrosion indicator could be a reference 
Lines/j01/j01-045/j01-045-02.png, 1638, 91, electrode of sodium saturated and equilibrated 
Lines/j01/j01-045/j01-045-03.png, 1664, 103, with niobium separated from the coolant by a 
Lines/j01/j01-045/j01-045-04.png, 1716, 110, solid anionic electrolyte . A negative voltage from 
Lines/j01/j01-045/j01-045-05.png, 1560, 99, the reference electrode would mean oxidizing 
Lines/j01/j01-045/j01-045-06.png, 1728, 97, conditions for niobium and positive voltage , non- 
Lines/j01/j01-045/j01-045-07.png, 1718, 103, oxidizing conditions . The practical application of 
Lines/j01/j01-045/j01-045-08.png, 1853, 95, the above idea will involve considerable experimenta- 
Lines/j01/j01-045/j01-045-09.png, 1124, 85, tion before it can be realised . 
Lines/j01/j01-049/j01-049-00.png, 1491, 112, The first requirement is for an anionic 
Lines/j01/j01-049/j01-049-01.png, 1651, 112, electrolyte , which can be fabricated into 
Lines/j01/j01-049/j01-049-02.png, 1706, 121, suitable shapes impervious to gases and 
Lines/j01/j01-049/j01-049-03.png, 1423, 117, liquid sodium and which is neither 
Lines/j01/j01-049/j01-049-04.png, 1472, 105, corroded by sodium nor by sodium

Lines/j01/j01-066/j01-066-00.png, 1738, 109, The probe can be evacuated and filled with inert gas 
Lines/j01/j01-066/j01-066-01.png, 1704, 118, via the tube L which must of course be electrically

Lines/j01/j01-066/j01-066-04.png, 1758, 103, but rather that it is worth a trial in the event of

Lines/h04/h04-021/h04-021-00.png, 1707, 102, As in 1958 , younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent 
Lines/h04/h04-021/h04-021-01.png, 1809, 98, more per calorie than the national average , and families 
Lines/h04/h04-021/h04-021-02.png, 1780, 105, with four or more children 19 per cent less . The only 
Lines/h04/h04-021/h04-021-03.png, 1861, 86, substantial change was in families with three children , 
Lines/h04/h04-021/h04-021-04.png, 1780, 90, for whom the index declined from 91 to 88 . Table 27

Lines/h04/h04-052/h04-052-03.png, 1818, 100, reduced their consumption of other vegetables . Purchases of 
Lines/h04/h04-052/h04-052-04.png, 1844, 83, quick-frozen peas and beans generally increased , but extreme- 
Lines/h04/h04-052/h04-052-05.png, 1807, 105, ly wide group differences persisted , the averages ranging from 
Lines/h04/h04-052/h04-052-06.png, 1823, 95, 0.1 oz. per head per week in families with four or more

Lines/h04/h04-082/h04-082-01.png, 1740, 98, years cannot be made so precisely as in groups with a 
Lines/h04/h04-082/h04-082-02.png, 1812, 61, defined number of children . In 1959 the households in 
Lines/h04/h04-082/h04-082-03.png, 1827, 100, this group contained slightly more children ( average 4.64 ) 
Lines/h04/h04-082/h04-082-04.png, 1823, 102, than in the previous year ( average 4.53 ) . Their total food 
Lines/h04/h04-082/h04-082-05.png, 1765, 101, expenditure increased less than that in other groups , 
Lines/h04/h04-082/h04-082-06.png, 1855, 83, and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish ,

Lines/f07/f07-009/f07-009-04.png, 1918, 167, always been strong in mankind . The sharing of 
Lines/f07/f07-009/f07-009-05.png, 1857, 140, a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an 
Lines/f07/f07-009/f07-009-06.png, 1919, 140, admittance into an acquaintanceship far more

Lines/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-05.png, 1727, 76, was a subject of no little importance to the Romans . 
Lines/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-06.png, 1763, 93, They considered flowers as forming a very essential 
Lines/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-07.png, 1673, 84, article in their festal preparations ; and it is the 
Lines/f07/f07-032a/f07-032a-08.png, 1534, 77, opinion of Bassius that at their desserts the

Lines/f07/f07-101b/f07-101b-02.png, 1621, 202, very funny story which made Carlyle absolutely laugh ; 
Lines/f07/f07-101b/f07-101b-03.png, 1631, 177, but all the Chelsea philosopher did in return was to

Lines/a05/a05-062/a05-062-02.png, 1866, 76, the Earl of Avon , the former Sir Anthony 
Lines/a05/a05-062/a05-062-03.png, 1850, 59, Eden , in his maiden speech in the House 
Lines/a05/a05-062/a05-062-04.png, 1749, 188, of Lords last night , gave a warning 
Lines/a05/a05-062/a05-062-05.png, 1783, 83, that # appeasement over Berlin could 
Lines/a05/a05-062/a05-062-06.png, 1811, 79, only lead to war . To stand firm , he 
Lines/a05/a05-062/a05-062-07.png, 1755, 78, declared , was not to invite war , but 
Lines/a05/a05-062/a05-062-08.png, 1207, 76, the surest way to avert it . 
Lines/a05/a05-089/a05-089-00.png, 1681, 71, The early speakers in the debate each 
Lines/a05/a05-089/a05-089-01.png, 1853, 70, severely rated the speech of his predecessor . 
Lines/a05/a05-089/a05-089-02.png, 1847, 76, These strictures were all too well justified . 
Lines/a05/a05-089/a05-089-03.png, 1794, 77, We started with the plaintive wailings 
Lines/a05/a05-089/a05-089-04.png, 1908, 110, of Mr. Healey , " Shadow " Foreign Secretary , 
Lines/a05/a05-089/a05-089-05.png, 1701, 71, described by Mr. Godber , Minister of 
Lines/a05/a05-089/a05-089-06.png, 1815, 82, State , Foreign Office , as " pedantic and 
Lines/a05/a05-089/a05-089-07.png, 1834, 89, obscure on Berlin , damaging and obscure 
Lines/a05/a05-089/a05-089-08.png, 1902, 80, on the Congo . " In turn , Mr. Godber was 
Lines/a05/a05-089/a05-089-09.png, 1876, 66, censured by Mr. Shinwell , former Labour 
Lines/a05/a05-089/a05-089-10.png, 1929, 85, Defence Minister , for having read the 
Lines/a05/a05-113/a05-113-00.png, 1792, 77, True , he did tell the House that the 
Lines/a05/a05-113/a05-113-01.png, 1921, 58, Government had asked the Medical Research 
Lines/a05/a05-113/a05-113-02.png, 1889, 71, Council to reassess the fall-out position in 
Lines/a05/a05-113/a05-113-03.png, 1869, 83, view of the Russian tests , and said that 
Lines/a05/a05-113/a05-113-04.png, 1951, 72, the council's findings would be published . 
Lines/a05/a05-113/a05-113-05.png, 1818, 68, He was not so happy in his defence of 
Lines/a05/a05-113/a05-113-06.png, 1730, 61, the Government's failure to condemn 
Lines/a05/a05-113/a05-113-07.png, 1782, 60, France for her nuclear tests in the 
Lines/a05/a05-113/a05-113-08.png, 1827, 67, Sahara on the grounds that they were 
Lines/a05/a05-113/a05-113-09.png, 847, 65, only little ones . 
Lines/a05/a05-084/a05-084-00.png, 1915, 73, The Russians now realised its seriousness . The 
Lines/a05/a05-084/a05-084-01.png, 1905, 59, French doubts were more about procedure 
Lines/a05/a05-084/a05-084-02.png, 1918, 75, than about substance . The Prime Minister's 
Lines/a05/a05-084/a05-084-03.png, 1897, 70, attitude of studied calm brought down the 
Lines/a05/a05-084/a05-084-04.png, 1820, 70, temperature of the debate , which never 
Lines/a05/a05-084/a05-084-05.png, 1729, 77, at any time rose to fever pitch , to a 
Lines/a05/a05-084/a05-084-06.png, 1642, 77, remarkable degree of sub-normality . 
Lines/a05/a05-084/a05-084-07.png, 1918, 85, Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl 
Lines/a05/a05-084/a05-084-08.png, 1864, 79, of Home , Foreign Secretary , was listening 
Lines/a05/a05-084/a05-084-09.png, 1096, 76, in the Peers' Gallery . 
Lines/a05/a05-104/a05-104-00.png, 1902, 85, Mr. Healey denounced the Government for 
Lines/a05/a05-104/a05-104-01.png, 1707, 67, using double standards . Ministers had 
Lines/a05/a05-104/a05-104-02.png, 1817, 62, rebuked the unaligned nations for not 
Lines/a05/a05-104/a05-104-03.png, 1769, 104, condemning the new Russian tests , but 
Lines/a05/a05-104/a05-104-04.png, 1816, 77, they themselves had no condemnation for 
Lines/a05/a05-104/a05-104-05.png, 1823, 67, events in Angola or Algeria . It was not for 
Lines/a05/a05-104/a05-104-06.png, 1755, 75, the Government , said Mr. Healey , to 
Lines/a05/a05-104/a05-104-07.png, 1853, 78, take up moral attitudes , " especially when 
Lines/a05/a05-104/a05-104-08.png, 1687, 81, the temple of their religion is the 
Lines/a05/a05-104/a05-104-09.png, 709, 75, bingo-parlour . " 
Lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-00.png, 1846, 63, The Minister regards the recent trend 
Lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-01.png, 1725, 86, of recruiting figures as encouraging . 
Lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-02.png, 1916, 61, He is confident the aim can be achieved . 
Lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-03.png, 1906, 68, While the possibility of an eventual return 
Lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-04.png, 1567, 60, to National Service in some form 
Lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-05.png, 1745, 67, cannot be entirely discounted , he does 
Lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-06.png, 1867, 68, not agree that the point has been reached 
Lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-07.png, 1776, 56, where this need even be considered . If 
Lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-08.png, 1570, 72, National Service is ever resorted to , 
Lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-09.png, 1887, 73, engagement would probably have to be for 
Lines/a05/a05-017/a05-017-10.png, 465, 51, three years . 
Lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-00.png, 1748, 98, Short of wearing the same uniform , which is 
Lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-01.png, 1740, 106, not contemplated , the Navy , Army and Royal 
Lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-02.png, 1915, 104, Air Force would become , for practical purposes , 
Lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-03.png, 1693, 108, a single defence force . There would be 
Lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-04.png, 1894, 118, complete co-operation at all levels in training 
Lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-05.png, 1925, 99, and operations . This would apply also in the 
Lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-06.png, 1941, 69, command structure and central administrative 
Lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-07.png, 2029, 128, organisation . Mr. Watkinson , Minister of Defence , 
Lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-08.png, 2073, 127, has been working on the plan for some months , 
Lines/a05/a05-004/a05-004-09.png, 1523, 124, with the Prime Minister's approval . 
Lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-00.png, 1733, 61, Criticisms about Army manpower appear 
Lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-01.png, 1871, 82, to have come mainly from retired officers 
Lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-02.png, 1827, 63, who have held high positions but 
Lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-03.png, 1903, 71, are out of touch with the existing situation . 
Lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-04.png, 1883, 69, Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support 
Lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-05.png, 1869, 95, from the C.I.G.S. , Field-Marshal Sir 
Lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-06.png, 1864, 70, Francis Festing , who believes completely 
Lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-07.png, 1933, 80, in the principle of an all-Regular army . 
Lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-08.png, 1914, 80, Gen. Sir Richard Hull , who is to succeed 
Lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-09.png, 1735, 87, Sir Francis , is equally convinced Mr. 
Lines/a05/a05-025/a05-025-10.png, 798, 57, Watkinson is right . 
Lines/a05/a05-053/a05-053-00.png, 1768, 74, He decided that it would be a great error 
Lines/a05/a05-053/a05-053-01.png, 1623, 66, to do so and to recall Parliament . But 
Lines/a05/a05-053/a05-053-02.png, 1768, 75, there would be no hesitation in mobilising 
Lines/a05/a05-053/a05-053-03.png, 1792, 77, if a further deterioration in the situation 
Lines/a05/a05-053/a05-053-04.png, 1848, 60, warranted such a step . It would have to be 
Lines/a05/a05-053/a05-053-05.png, 1943, 80, accompanied by other measures of a military , 
Lines/a05/a05-053/a05-053-06.png, 1918, 84, economic and political kind . Mr. Macmillan , 
Lines/a05/a05-053/a05-053-07.png, 1751, 71, who was winding up the foreign affairs 
Lines/a05/a05-053/a05-053-08.png, 1783, 68, debate , said the Government could not 
Lines/a05/a05-053/a05-053-09.png, 1590, 69, be party to accepting as a matter of 
Lines/a05/a05-053/a05-053-10.png, 1836, 66, principle the imposed division of Germany . 
Lines/a05/a05-069/a05-069-00.png, 1617, 61, It was the end of a rather curious 
Lines/a05/a05-069/a05-069-01.png, 1792, 65, speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up 
Lines/a05/a05-069/a05-069-02.png, 1753, 70, the two-day debate on foreign affairs . 
Lines/a05/a05-069/a05-069-03.png, 1851, 67, He began in a low , almost chatty mono- 
Lines/a05/a05-069/a05-069-04.png, 1693, 81, tone , and his voice never rose to any 
Lines/a05/a05-069/a05-069-05.png, 1800, 79, accent of urgency . He passed in rapid 
Lines/a05/a05-069/a05-069-06.png, 1692, 83, review the United Nations Secretariat ; 
Lines/a05/a05-069/a05-069-07.png, 1893, 81, nuclear tests ; the canard about British 
Lines/a05/a05-069/a05-069-08.png, 1756, 77, interference with the United Nations 
Lines/a05/a05-069/a05-069-09.png, 1928, 88, in the Congo ; Kuwait ; and South-East 
Lines/a05/a05-069/a05-069-10.png, 178, 56, Asia . 
Lines/a05/a05-094/a05-094-00.png, 1724, 63, The trouble about such debates is that 
Lines/a05/a05-094/a05-094-01.png, 1865, 73, they range too widely . They remind one of 
Lines/a05/a05-094/a05-094-02.png, 2074, 87, the Rugby match in " Tom Brown's Schooldays , " 
Lines/a05/a05-094/a05-094-03.png, 1751, 62, in which all the boys were welcome to 
Lines/a05/a05-094/a05-094-04.png, 1889, 80, take part , and only those who " really meant 
Lines/a05/a05-094/a05-094-05.png, 1880, 64, business " removed their jackets . Not many 
Lines/a05/a05-094/a05-094-06.png, 1767, 64, metaphorical braces were visible in the 
Lines/a05/a05-094/a05-094-07.png, 1681, 80, early stages of to-night's debate . Mr. 
Lines/a05/a05-094/a05-094-08.png, 2007, 100, Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's 
Lines/a05/a05-094/a05-094-09.png, 1736, 84, golf-course Press conference , which he 
Lines/a05/a05-094/a05-094-10.png, 1832, 76, described as " a display of flabby and 
Lines/a05/a05-048/a05-048-00.png, 1778, 72, Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was 
Lines/a05/a05-048/a05-048-01.png, 1537, 55, evident that voters were bored by the 
Lines/a05/a05-048/a05-048-02.png, 1902, 63, Government's frequent appeals to the electorate . 
Lines/a05/a05-048/a05-048-03.png, 1816, 67, The election was the fourth in four years . 
Lines/a05/a05-048/a05-048-04.png, 1726, 65, In most constituencies it may go down as 
Lines/a05/a05-048/a05-048-05.png, 1776, 80, the most apathetic in the country's history . 
Lines/a05/a05-048/a05-048-06.png, 1884, 60, THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons 
Lines/a05/a05-048/a05-048-07.png, 1733, 57, last night that he had considered early 
Lines/a05/a05-048/a05-048-08.png, 1822, 74, in the Parliamentary recess whether to 
Lines/a05/a05-048/a05-048-09.png, 1675, 69, mobilise reserves necessary to bring the 
Lines/a05/a05-048/a05-048-10.png, 1904, 78, British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing . 
Lines/a05/a05-116/a05-116-00.png, 1832, 61, This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid 
Lines/a05/a05-116/a05-116-01.png, 1810, 78, and her illegitimate baby . For the most 
Lines/a05/a05-116/a05-116-02.png, 1682, 87, part , Mr. Godber muttered his way 
Lines/a05/a05-116/a05-116-03.png, 1793, 90, through a cliche-ridden Foreign Office 
Lines/a05/a05-116/a05-116-04.png, 1918, 72, brief . He resembles the elephant seal , an 
Lines/a05/a05-116/a05-116-05.png, 1811, 68, # otherwise endearing creature whose 
Lines/a05/a05-116/a05-116-06.png, 1913, 79, articulation is limited , we are told , to a 
Lines/a05/a05-116/a05-116-07.png, 1888, 82, series of heavy sighs . Sir Lynn Ungoed- 
Lines/a05/a05-116/a05-116-08.png, 1975, 87, Thomas , M.P. for Leicester N.E. , a former 
Lines/a05/a05-116/a05-116-09.png, 2002, 50, Labour Solicitor-General , and Mrs. Barbara 
Lines/a05/a05-108/a05-108-00.png, 1805, 79, This puzzled such students of comparative 
Lines/a05/a05-108/a05-108-01.png, 1813, 94, religion as had failed to detect this cult . 
Lines/a05/a05-108/a05-108-02.png, 1674, 80, But Mr. Healey had a partial and 
Lines/a05/a05-108/a05-108-03.png, 1747, 71, limited success . He rallied behind him 
Lines/a05/a05-108/a05-108-04.png, 1908, 79, the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last 
Lines/a05/a05-108/a05-108-05.png, 1851, 83, night by his leader , Mr. Gaitskell . Mr. 
Lines/a05/a05-108/a05-108-06.png, 1869, 81, Godber's performance merited all the mild 
Lines/a05/a05-108/a05-108-07.png, 1763, 71, scorn heaped on it by Mr. Shinwell . 
Lines/a05/a05-044/a05-044-00.png, 1494, 62, The defeat of the leader of the 
Lines/a05/a05-044/a05-044-01.png, 1748, 89, Progressive party , Dr. Steytler , in Port 
Lines/a05/a05-044/a05-044-02.png, 1755, 73, Elizabeth South , announced immediately 
Lines/a05/a05-044/a05-044-03.png, 1802, 84, afterwards by the United party candidate , 
Lines/a05/a05-044/a05-044-04.png, 1890, 78, Mr. Plewman , left the Progressives deprived 
Lines/a05/a05-044/a05-044-05.png, 1970, 70, of both their chief figures . Dr. Verwoerd and 
Lines/a05/a05-044/a05-044-06.png, 1744, 90, the Leader of the Opposition , Sir de 
Lines/a05/a05-044/a05-044-07.png, 2046, 78, Villiers Graaff , have been returned unopposed . 
Lines/a05/a05-044/a05-044-08.png, 1748, 65, The contests were for 86 seats as 70 
Lines/a05/a05-044/a05-044-09.png, 1866, 78, Nationalists and 20 United party candi- 
Lines/a05/a05-044/a05-044-10.png, 894, 55, dates are unopposed . 
Lines/a05/a05-073/a05-073-00.png, 1744, 75, He spent most of his short half-hour on 
Lines/a05/a05-073/a05-073-01.png, 1799, 81, Berlin . He deplored the possibility of 
Lines/a05/a05-073/a05-073-02.png, 1900, 89, some " new myth " about betrayal of Germany 
Lines/a05/a05-073/a05-073-03.png, 1916, 86, by the Allies . " We do not , " he said , " really 
Lines/a05/a05-073/a05-073-04.png, 1857, 76, know what the Russians want . " But he was 
Lines/a05/a05-073/a05-073-05.png, 1775, 71, certain that they wanted to establish a 
Lines/a05/a05-073/a05-073-06.png, 1814, 76, final and irrevocable division of Germany . 
Lines/a05/a05-073/a05-073-07.png, 1921, 68, Britain could not be a party to an imposed 
Lines/a05/a05-073/a05-073-08.png, 1892, 90, division . But negotiation , as the debate had 
Lines/a05/a05-073/a05-073-09.png, 1783, 69, shown , could be undertaken on a variety 
Lines/a05/a05-073/a05-073-10.png, 414, 66, of bases . 
Lines/a05/a05-099/a05-099-00.png, 1852, 75, A reference to the reunification of Germany

Lines/a05/a05-029/a05-029-02.png, 1712, 75, September , was delayed because of the 
Lines/a05/a05-029/a05-029-03.png, 1943, 70, Berlin crisis . Mr. Watkinson and his advisers 
Lines/a05/a05-029/a05-029-04.png, 1777, 67, felt the change would be unwise at a

Lines/a05/a05-039/a05-039-02.png, 1772, 63, the Prime Minister . This implies the dis- 
Lines/a05/a05-039/a05-039-03.png, 1833, 83, appearance of the Progressive party from 
Lines/a05/a05-039/a05-039-04.png, 1840, 81, the House . Early results in yesterday's

Lines/k03/k03-157/k03-157-03.png, 1914, 83, The Prime Minister continued in his flippant

Lines/k03/k03-157/k03-157-05.png, 1827, 84, talking-to . ' The Chancellor closed his eyes , 
Lines/k03/k03-157/k03-157-06.png, 616, 40, and then said , 
Lines/k03/k03-117/k03-117-00.png, 1683, 130, After lunch two of the Prime Minister's 
Lines/k03/k03-117/k03-117-01.png, 1875, 139, grandchildren who had sat , rather intimidated

Lines/k03/k03-117/k03-117-05.png, 1834, 119, men together . A nurse came in , and asked 
Lines/k03/k03-117/k03-117-06.png, 1657, 116, the Prime Minister if he wanted to be 
Lines/k03/k03-117/k03-117-07.png, 1926, 106, helped out on to the lawn , but he waved 
Lines/k03/k03-117/k03-117-08.png, 1076, 125, her away impatiently . 
Lines/k03/k03-138/k03-138-00.png, 1585, 136, I don't mean just our direct military costs . I 'm 
Lines/k03/k03-138/k03-138-01.png, 1709, 153, thinking of the African Boycott which is already working up . 
Lines/k03/k03-138/k03-138-02.png, 1624, 140, I 'm afraid , Prime Minister , you 're not going to like the

Lines/k03/k03-138/k03-138-04.png, 1599, 122, Prime Minister commented wearily . The Chancellor 
Lines/k03/k03-138/k03-138-05.png, 1683, 137, was repeating an argument which he had already 
Lines/k03/k03-138/k03-138-06.png, 1245, 135, developed for an hour before lunch . 
Lines/k03/k03-180/k03-180-00.png, 1917, 99, The Prime Minister looked puzzled , and said , ' Julia Drayford ? How 
Lines/k03/k03-180/k03-180-01.png, 2030, 104, does she come into it ? I can't follow these complexities - ' ' It isn't 
Lines/k03/k03-180/k03-180-02.png, 2078, 123, quite that . The whole business blew up from Melville's disgraceful 
Lines/k03/k03-180/k03-180-03.png, 1980, 94, indiscretion to Julia Drayford in Mrs. M'landa's presence . 
Lines/k03/k03-180/k03-180-04.png, 1970, 114, I don't know the exact chain of gossip or who told who 
Lines/k03/k03-180/k03-180-05.png, 166, 65, what . 
Lines/k03/k03-152/k03-152-00.png, 1791, 91, ' Only at yesterday's meeting - they 're very restless , Prime 
Lines/k03/k03-152/k03-152-01.png, 1689, 89, Minister . They feel that it 's very old-fashioned - shooting 
Lines/k03/k03-152/k03-152-02.png, 1758, 94, down mobs of natives . They 're very much afraid that 
Lines/k03/k03-152/k03-152-03.png, 1762, 104, if the Opposition get a Commission of Enquiry some 
Lines/k03/k03-152/k03-152-04.png, 1534, 85, rather dismal stuff is going to come out . ' 
Lines/k03/k03-152/k03-152-05.png, 1695, 95, ' Young back-benchers are always restive when they 're

Lines/k03/k03-152/k03-152-07.png, 1807, 76, time since his grandchildren left the table , he smiled . 
Lines/k03/k03-164/k03-164-00.png, 1749, 93, ' I think it 's gone beyond that , Prime Minister . 
Lines/k03/k03-164/k03-164-01.png, 2028, 91, They feel pretty strongly about Africa . They are greatly 
Lines/k03/k03-164/k03-164-02.png, 1897, 85, disturbed by the new and rather ugly image of

Lines/k03/k03-164/k03-164-04.png, 1746, 75, On the whole , the country is still in favour 
Lines/k03/k03-164/k03-164-05.png, 1886, 54, of moderation and common sense . Melville has 
Lines/k03/k03-164/k03-164-06.png, 1821, 112, in a curious way made us look old-fashioned 
Lines/k03/k03-164/k03-164-07.png, 1632, 85, - extravagant - nineteenth centuryish - 
Lines/k03/k03-164/k03-164-08.png, 662, 93, almost cranky . ' 
Lines/k03/k03-144/k03-144-00.png, 1537, 91, ' It comes at a bad time , ' said

Lines/h05/h05-012/h05-012-01.png, 1762, 103, are highway payments , clearance payments ( for clearing remains of

Lines/h05/h05-012/h05-012-03.png, 1689, 105, differing in certain important ways from the ordinary cost of 
Lines/h05/h05-012/h05-012-04.png, 1657, 95, works payments , the sums paid under these heads have the 
Lines/h05/h05-012/h05-012-05.png, 1725, 99, common feature that they are all payments in respect of works 
Lines/h05/h05-012/h05-012-06.png, 832, 61, which have been carried out . 
Lines/f01/f01-081/f01-081-00.png, 1751, 178, We must beware , however , of supposing that there must be any 
Lines/f01/f01-081/f01-081-01.png, 1633, 222, close analogy between the units of quite different 
Lines/f01/f01-081/f01-081-02.png, 1635, 190, sciences . For example the success of the atomic theory 
Lines/f01/f01-081/f01-081-03.png, 1683, 158, in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate 
Lines/f01/f01-081/f01-081-04.png, 1579, 191, units of geometry must be points . It would be more 
Lines/f01/f01-081/f01-081-05.png, 1635, 246, correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of 
Lines/f01/f01-081/f01-081-06.png, 401, 182, geometry . 
Lines/f01/f01-058/f01-058-00.png, 1573, 168, Thus learning how to learn means becoming

Lines/f01/f01-058/f01-058-02.png, 1635, 117, and your own teacher . You will then be 
Lines/f01/f01-058/f01-058-03.png, 1756, 94, a well-established learner and the world 
Lines/f01/f01-058/f01-058-04.png, 1636, 161, will be at your feet . Although the word 
Lines/f01/f01-058/f01-058-05.png, 1388, 125, " mind " has given rise to endless 
Lines/f01/f01-058/f01-058-06.png, 1752, 136, controversy among philosophers and psycho- 
Lines/f01/f01-058/f01-058-07.png, 1626, 121, logists , many of whom would like to

Lines/f01/f01-058/f01-058-09.png, 1543, 172, of us obstinately go on using it . 
Lines/f01/f01-135/f01-135-00.png, 1729, 175, It is the tendency to get things 
Lines/f01/f01-135/f01-135-01.png, 1699, 189, the wrong way round . As a 
Lines/f01/f01-135/f01-135-02.png, 1765, 177, psychologist I am constantly 
Lines/f01/f01-135/f01-135-03.png, 1747, 196, encountering this tendency 
Lines/f01/f01-135/f01-135-04.png, 1958, 168, in friends and acquaintances . 
Lines/f01/f01-135/f01-135-05.png, 1935, 211, They think there is something 
Lines/f01/f01-135/f01-135-06.png, 2069, 216, inevitably " queer " about psychology 
Lines/f01/f01-135/f01-135-07.png, 1975, 218, and this feeling of queerness 
Lines/f01/f01-135/f01-135-08.png, 2015, 183, usually boils down to a quite 
Lines/f01/f01-135/f01-135-09.png, 1785, 154, mistaken belief that the 
Lines/f01/f01-135/f01-135-10.png, 2048, 204, psychologist first looks into ... 
Lines/f01/f01-075/f01-075-00.png, 1730, 95, At one time it was thought that mind could indeed 
Lines/f01/f01-075/f01-075-01.png, 1727, 106, be analysed into discrete bits . These bits were 
Lines/f01/f01-075/f01-075-02.png, 1791, 106, identified as elementary sensations . These were 
Lines/f01/f01-075/f01-075-03.png, 1749, 109, thought to combine together to form compound 
Lines/f01/f01-075/f01-075-04.png, 1699, 111, experiences by analogy with the way atoms of 
Lines/f01/f01-075/f01-075-05.png, 1707, 94, matter combine to form molecular compounds . 
Lines/f01/f01-075/f01-075-06.png, 1765, 111, But this view led to too many difficulties and 
Lines/f01/f01-075/f01-075-07.png, 1714, 104, was finally abandoned . Nevertheless the search 
Lines/f01/f01-075/f01-075-08.png, 1706, 95, for basic units of mind has gone on and will 
Lines/f01/f01-075/f01-075-09.png, 1730, 99, doubtless continue , for it is the aim of science to 
Lines/f01/f01-075/f01-075-10.png, 882, 72, discover ultimate units . 
Lines/f01/f01-085/f01-085-00.png, 1652, 212, There have been many conflicting tendencies in 
Lines/f01/f01-085/f01-085-01.png, 1791, 227, psychology in its search for ultimate units and here 
Lines/f01/f01-085/f01-085-02.png, 1755, 170, we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising 
Lines/f01/f01-085/f01-085-03.png, 1766, 187, concept which is current today . It is known as the schema .

Lines/f01/f01-085/f01-085-05.png, 1658, 165, concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification 
Lines/f01/f01-085/f01-085-06.png, 1653, 215, but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction . 
Lines/f01/f01-053/f01-053-00.png, 1743, 150, The job of the teacher is to set the learner's 
Lines/f01/f01-053/f01-053-01.png, 1693, 125, vocabulary to work on the existing store 
Lines/f01/f01-053/f01-053-02.png, 1623, 124, so as to make it grow . He does not

Lines/f01/f01-053/f01-053-04.png, 1555, 144, The solitary learner has to find out 
Lines/f01/f01-053/f01-053-05.png, 1689, 134, how to do this for himself , with the help 
Lines/f01/f01-053/f01-053-06.png, 1586, 135, of books . He uses his vocabulary to 
Lines/f01/f01-053/f01-053-07.png, 1606, 143, ask questions and uses the books to 
Lines/f01/f01-053/f01-053-08.png, 685, 127, find the answers . 
Lines/f01/f01-139/f01-139-00.png, 1731, 123, This is what I mean by " getting things the wrong way 
Lines/f01/f01-139/f01-139-01.png, 1773, 118, round " . He is far more likely to find out about how 
Lines/f01/f01-139/f01-139-02.png, 1707, 130, his own mind works by looking at other people's . 
Lines/f01/f01-139/f01-139-03.png, 1696, 111, For although looking inwards ( or " introspecting " 
Lines/f01/f01-139/f01-139-04.png, 1572, 116, as it is called ) , is not entirely ruled out , 
Lines/f01/f01-139/f01-139-05.png, 1714, 122, nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is 
Lines/f01/f01-139/f01-139-06.png, 1596, 120, one of the most unreliable methods of getting 
Lines/f01/f01-139/f01-139-07.png, 784, 109, any precise information . 
Lines/f01/f01-147/f01-147-00.png, 1676, 114, He may never have had the disease himself but he 
Lines/f01/f01-147/f01-147-01.png, 1745, 129, can nevertheless identify it . Similarly the psychologist has 
Lines/f01/f01-147/f01-147-02.png, 1785, 108, to be prepared to observe and make inferences about 
Lines/f01/f01-147/f01-147-03.png, 1790, 127, all kinds of processes in other people , whether or not they 
Lines/f01/f01-147/f01-147-04.png, 1781, 122, correspond with anything in his own experience . We know 
Lines/f01/f01-147/f01-147-05.png, 1684, 126, very little about the patterns of brain-activity which 
Lines/f01/f01-147/f01-147-06.png, 1680, 116, provide our schemas , nor do we need to know as far as 
Lines/f01/f01-147/f01-147-07.png, 1791, 121, psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of 
Lines/f01/f01-147/f01-147-08.png, 779, 128, the neuro-physiologists . 
Lines/f01/f01-143/f01-143-00.png, 1784, 119, And so they prefer objective methods . Since they cannot 
Lines/f01/f01-143/f01-143-01.png, 1702, 117, directly look into the mental processes of another 
Lines/f01/f01-143/f01-143-02.png, 1728, 113, person they observe his visible behaviour and then try 
Lines/f01/f01-143/f01-143-03.png, 1680, 121, to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind 
Lines/f01/f01-143/f01-143-04.png, 1831, 111, this behaviour . This is no more queer than the method 
Lines/f01/f01-143/f01-143-05.png, 1763, 114, of the doctor who observes signs , and records symptoms , 
Lines/f01/f01-143/f01-143-06.png, 1784, 120, and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them . 
Lines/f01/f01-066/f01-066-00.png, 1752, 197, And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of 
Lines/f01/f01-066/f01-066-01.png, 1881, 154, " mind " vanishes , at any rate for some time . It seems very difficult 
Lines/f01/f01-066/f01-066-02.png, 1764, 153, to detach the mind from the brain , and all the biological , 
Lines/f01/f01-066/f01-066-03.png, 1734, 145, surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very 
Lines/f01/f01-066/f01-066-04.png, 1884, 152, close connection . There is a lot to be said for keeping the 
Lines/f01/f01-066/f01-066-05.png, 2042, 169, word " soul " to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable 
Lines/f01/f01-066/f01-066-06.png, 1801, 137, essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from 
Lines/f01/f01-066/f01-066-07.png, 1866, 148, the body , and to reserve the more prosaic word " mind " for 
Lines/f01/f01-066/f01-066-08.png, 1853, 149, the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which 
Lines/f01/f01-066/f01-066-09.png, 1355, 154, are clearly associated with the brain . 
Lines/f01/f01-070/f01-070-00.png, 1835, 164, Can we now put forward any reasonably clear 
Lines/f01/f01-070/f01-070-01.png, 1940, 140, picture of this " basis " of mental phenomena ? 
Lines/f01/f01-070/f01-070-02.png, 1909, 136, The physicists have succeeded remarkably well ,

Lines/f01/f01-070/f01-070-07.png, 2000, 153, theories of " mind " ? Are there any ultimate units 
Lines/f01/f01-070/f01-070-08.png, 1646, 134, of mind akin to the atoms of matter ?

Lines/e01/e01-055/e01-055-04.png, 1855, 121, numerous other crocheted pieces . It was some years 
Lines/e01/e01-055/e01-055-05.png, 1808, 132, after the Victorian period that designers realised 
Lines/e01/e01-055/e01-055-06.png, 1718, 120, the potentialities of the craft , and crochet was 
Lines/e01/e01-055/e01-055-07.png, 1739, 130, revived with designs suitable for contemporary 
Lines/e01/e01-055/e01-055-08.png, 1826, 138, trends . Crochet today has a variety of uses , and

Lines/e01/e01-102/e01-102-01.png, 1775, 97, the beauty of crochet . The finer mercerised threads 
Lines/e01/e01-102/e01-102-02.png, 1718, 91, are more effective for the delicate designs used for 
Lines/e01/e01-102/e01-102-03.png, 1748, 99, tablecloths , doilies , edgings and accessories , while 
Lines/e01/e01-102/e01-102-04.png, 1546, 91, the heavier threads are used for bedspreads ,

Lines/e01/e01-025/e01-025-00.png, 1751, 166, But lace-making is by no means a lost 
Lines/e01/e01-025/e01-025-01.png, 1676, 136, art . It suffered a decline and fell into 
Lines/e01/e01-025/e01-025-02.png, 1645, 176, lamentably low standards in the fussy

Lines/e01/e01-025/e01-025-04.png, 1707, 176, but it would take more than a temporary 
Lines/e01/e01-025/e01-025-05.png, 1720, 174, lapse in good taste to destroy this lovely , 
Lines/e01/e01-025/e01-025-06.png, 1581, 153, viable craft . It has , in fact , readily

Lines/e01/e01-014/e01-014-00.png, 1553, 97, We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys 
Lines/e01/e01-014/e01-014-01.png, 1604, 128, that he was a great man for lace - paying 
Lines/e01/e01-014/e01-014-02.png, 1539, 88, as much as 3 for a lace collar . But this 
Lines/e01/e01-014/e01-014-03.png, 1735, 125, didn't mean he was prepared to do as much 
Lines/e01/e01-014/e01-014-04.png, 1681, 119, for his lady , for he records testily : ' My wife 
Lines/e01/e01-014/e01-014-05.png, 1574, 134, and I fell out about my not being willing

Lines/e01/e01-018/e01-018-00.png, 1759, 127, We read , with sympathy , an advertisement in the

Lines/e01/e01-018/e01-018-07.png, 1629, 125, are very touching but then lace does place 
Lines/e01/e01-018/e01-018-08.png, 1439, 121, upon everything a delicate sentiment . 
Lines/e01/e01-050/e01-050-00.png, 1607, 148, During the sixteenth century a considerable 
Lines/e01/e01-050/e01-050-01.png, 1520, 105, amount of crochet was produced in the 
Lines/e01/e01-050/e01-050-02.png, 1672, 104, convents of Europe . Without doubt it was the 
Lines/e01/e01-050/e01-050-03.png, 1743, 119, nuns who carried the craft to Ireland . There it 
Lines/e01/e01-050/e01-050-04.png, 1830, 107, was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive 
Lines/e01/e01-050/e01-050-05.png, 1768, 134, form with rosettes , leaves and lace fillings . During 
Lines/e01/e01-050/e01-050-06.png, 1619, 121, the time of Victoria this gentle craft was 
Lines/e01/e01-050/e01-050-07.png, 548, 136, greatly abused . 
Lines/e01/e01-062/e01-062-00.png, 1782, 82, In the home , crochet lace can be used to make 
Lines/e01/e01-062/e01-062-01.png, 1669, 114, tablecloths , traycloths and runners , and edgings

Lines/e01/e01-062/e01-062-03.png, 1813, 106, functions . The art of crochet is not difficult and 
Lines/e01/e01-062/e01-062-04.png, 1646, 138, it is reasonably quick to work . In the following 
Lines/e01/e01-062/e01-062-05.png, 1783, 110, pages simple diagrams and instructions are given

Lines/e01/e01-035/e01-035-04.png, 1801, 100, boys as well . Whole families made their 
Lines/e01/e01-035/e01-035-05.png, 1763, 103, livelihood by lace-making and consequently 
Lines/e01/e01-035/e01-035-06.png, 1752, 97, a folklore of song , festival and courtship grew 
Lines/e01/e01-035/e01-035-07.png, 1119, 82, up around the lace industry . 
Lines/e01/e01-032/e01-032-00.png, 1547, 96, The more delicate patterns and finer 
Lines/e01/e01-032/e01-032-01.png, 1729, 116, threads may be reserved to bring a light

Lines/e01/e01-032/e01-032-06.png, 1562, 107, distinction that nothing else can give . 
Lines/e01/e01-032/e01-032-07.png, 1731, 115, Although we assess lace-making as one of 
Lines/e01/e01-032/e01-032-08.png, 1791, 96, the feminine skills , a number of the well-loved

Lines/b04/b04-195/b04-195-03.png, 1689, 176, an honours degree course . Farming is Britain's 
Lines/b04/b04-195/b04-195-04.png, 1728, 171, most vital industry . It is increasingly dependent 
Lines/b04/b04-195/b04-195-05.png, 1767, 145, on new techniques - and on the universities to 
Lines/b04/b04-195/b04-195-06.png, 1356, 163, provide men of knowledge and skill . 
Lines/b04/b04-121/b04-121-00.png, 1860, 103, But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well 
Lines/b04/b04-121/b04-121-01.png, 1719, 87, be plunged into chaos , like the Congo . For Mr. 
Lines/b04/b04-121/b04-121-02.png, 1813, 95, Macmillan and his ministers there is no choice . They 
Lines/b04/b04-121/b04-121-03.png, 1758, 83, must safeguard Rhodesia against chaos . And try to 
Lines/b04/b04-121/b04-121-04.png, 1856, 79, repair the damage they have done . WHO can grow the 
Lines/b04/b04-121/b04-121-05.png, 1717, 90, fastest ? That is the exciting competition going on 
Lines/b04/b04-121/b04-121-06.png, 1175, 82, among Britain's major industries . 
Lines/b04/b04-075/b04-075-00.png, 1704, 110, They intend to sit outside the Ministry of Defence . It is 
Lines/b04/b04-075/b04-075-01.png, 1665, 123, their protest against the H-bomb . They ought to have a 
Lines/b04/b04-075/b04-075-02.png, 1786, 106, pleasant time . The weather forecast is good ; except for them , 
Lines/b04/b04-075/b04-075-03.png, 1837, 104, Whitehall should be deserted . And they will have a fine view 
Lines/b04/b04-075/b04-075-04.png, 1731, 99, of St. James's Park , with its placid lake , pelicans ,

Lines/b04/b04-089/b04-089-02.png, 1875, 226, talents and responsibilities could bring in the open 
Lines/b04/b04-089/b04-089-03.png, 1858, 187, labour market . The unions are fortunate indeed to 
Lines/b04/b04-089/b04-089-04.png, 1860, 200, find dedicated leaders at cut-rate prices . But it is 
Lines/b04/b04-089/b04-089-05.png, 1884, 203, time the members decided to pay up and be good 
Lines/b04/b04-089/b04-089-06.png, 1781, 248, employers . THE Labour Party says that the Tory 
Lines/b04/b04-089/b04-089-07.png, 1609, 183, Government is destroying the social services .

Lines/b04/b04-054/b04-054-02.png, 1748, 108, five years . During this period Britain will be expected 
Lines/b04/b04-054/b04-054-03.png, 1722, 113, to subsidise and defend the Cypriots . They will enjoy 
Lines/b04/b04-054/b04-054-04.png, 1711, 131, all the trading benefits of Imperial Preference . It is a 
Lines/b04/b04-054/b04-054-05.png, 1808, 116, safe bet that at the end of five years Makarios and 
Lines/b04/b04-054/b04-054-06.png, 956, 105, company will sign on again . 
Lines/b04/b04-116/b04-116-00.png, 1783, 99, And as the British Government stepped up the pace 
Lines/b04/b04-116/b04-116-01.png, 1895, 93, of change , so the Africans stepped up their demands . 
Lines/b04/b04-116/b04-116-02.png, 1854, 96, TODAY , in London , that rash and thoughtless policy has 
Lines/b04/b04-116/b04-116-03.png, 1903, 83, caused a crisis - a crisis that never should have happened . 
Lines/b04/b04-116/b04-116-04.png, 1814, 84, No wonder there is doubt and fearful heart-searching . 
Lines/b04/b04-116/b04-116-05.png, 1722, 95, If the Government now reverses its plan to give the

Lines/b04/b04-116/b04-116-07.png, 1818, 85, difficulties from African politicians greedy for power . 
Lines/b04/b04-096/b04-096-00.png, 1838, 200, Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the 
Lines/b04/b04-096/b04-096-01.png, 1830, 213, national income was spent on social services . The 
Lines/b04/b04-096/b04-096-02.png, 1806, 226, present figure is 19.5 per cent. There are many 
Lines/b04/b04-096/b04-096-03.png, 1874, 239, worthwhile targets for the Opposition . What a pity 
Lines/b04/b04-096/b04-096-04.png, 1850, 185, to aim at the wrong one ! MRS. MARCIA POWER , 
Lines/b04/b04-096/b04-096-05.png, 1879, 186, whose husband made her clean his uniform , wins 
Lines/b04/b04-096/b04-096-06.png, 1923, 203, a divorce . The judge says she had to act almost 
Lines/b04/b04-096/b04-096-07.png, 377, 178, as a serf . 
Lines/b04/b04-010/b04-010-00.png, 1738, 100, Who will speak for Belgium ? Who else but 
Lines/b04/b04-010/b04-010-01.png, 1731, 98, Britain . We have fought beside Belgium 
Lines/b04/b04-010/b04-010-02.png, 1666, 51, in two world wars . We are allies still . 
Lines/b04/b04-010/b04-010-03.png, 1665, 98, Britain should champion Belgium . Not

Lines/b04/b04-010/b04-010-05.png, 1765, 114, but boldly and fearlessly . It is time to 
Lines/b04/b04-010/b04-010-06.png, 1845, 107, show the world that this country does not 
Lines/b04/b04-010/b04-010-07.png, 1575, 110, desert her friends . HAPPY , happy 
Lines/b04/b04-010/b04-010-08.png, 1751, 151, families ! Never before have Britain's

Lines/b04/b04-004/b04-004-00.png, 1639, 86, In Ghana , President Nkrumah , who 
Lines/b04/b04-004/b04-004-01.png, 1589, 102, has done more than most to stir up 
Lines/b04/b04-004/b04-004-02.png, 1767, 105, trouble in the Congo , orders every Belgian 
Lines/b04/b04-004/b04-004-03.png, 1651, 84, citizen to quit his country . HOUNDING 
Lines/b04/b04-004/b04-004-04.png, 1695, 98, Belgium has become an international 
Lines/b04/b04-004/b04-004-05.png, 1695, 118, pastime . Why ? Because those who 
Lines/b04/b04-004/b04-004-06.png, 1811, 105, said the Congolese could govern themselves 
Lines/b04/b04-004/b04-004-07.png, 1654, 107, will not admit they were wrong . So 
Lines/b04/b04-004/b04-004-08.png, 1561, 103, Belgium , bowed down by internal 
Lines/b04/b04-004/b04-004-09.png, 1675, 91, troubles , mourning a terrible air crash , 
Lines/b04/b04-004/b04-004-10.png, 1110, 104, is made their scapegoat . 
Lines/b03/b03-025/b03-025-00.png, 1867, 123, But discussion on current points of east-west con- 
Lines/b03/b03-025/b03-025-01.png, 1870, 127, flict could not go much farther than , for example , the 
Lines/b03/b03-025/b03-025-02.png, 1936, 117, truism that policies of menace and mutual disarmament 
Lines/b03/b03-025/b03-025-03.png, 2027, 115, cannot be followed together . What the council has done - 
Lines/b03/b03-025/b03-025-04.png, 1905, 108, and it is an achievement - is to make religious con- 
Lines/b03/b03-025/b03-025-05.png, 1787, 115, tact across the greatest political barrier in what 
Lines/b03/b03-025/b03-025-06.png, 1137, 110, is not yet a unitary world . 
Lines/b03/b03-109/b03-109-00.png, 1693, 109, Can it be shown that the one scale is demon- 
Lines/b03/b03-109/b03-109-01.png, 1720, 177, strably better than the other ? The centigraders may 
Lines/b03/b03-109/b03-109-02.png, 1740, 205, be in for a stiffer fight than they think . They may 
Lines/b03/b03-109/b03-109-03.png, 1830, 199, have to call up the reinforcement of the Common Market . 
Lines/b03/b03-109/b03-109-04.png, 1750, 203, Even then it might be easier to persuade the British 
Lines/b03/b03-109/b03-109-05.png, 1619, 188, public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain 
Lines/b03/b03-109/b03-109-06.png, 1766, 129, circumstances the time would come when this would 
Lines/b03/b03-109/b03-109-07.png, 1686, 193, suit their convenience - rather than to change their 
Lines/b03/b03-109/b03-109-08.png, 1180, 198, system of recording temperatures . 
Lines/b03/b03-087/b03-087-00.png, 1640, 83, The notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the 
Lines/b03/b03-087/b03-087-01.png, 1720, 85, agreement is signed . To this there will be some opposition . The Bill is 
Lines/b03/b03-087/b03-087-02.png, 1737, 76, short and modest in scope , and it is doubtful whether the other Private 
Lines/b03/b03-087/b03-087-03.png, 1755, 102, Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps . This fact may give 
Lines/b03/b03-087/b03-087-04.png, 1702, 99, the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience until the 
Lines/b03/b03-087/b03-087-05.png, 997, 82, next report from the Molony committee . 
Lines/b03/b03-098/b03-098-00.png, 1688, 128, The press and the broadcasting authorities are 
Lines/b03/b03-098/b03-098-01.png, 1767, 111, asked to help . To begin with , both tempe- 
Lines/b03/b03-098/b03-098-02.png, 1704, 121, ratures will be put in the ring together . 
Lines/b03/b03-098/b03-098-03.png, 1758, 101, SIR GRAHAM SUTTON , however , made no bones 
Lines/b03/b03-098/b03-098-04.png, 1750, 133, about it yesterday . The purpose is to give 
Lines/b03/b03-098/b03-098-05.png, 1764, 110, fahrenheit the knock out . The backers of 
Lines/b03/b03-098/b03-098-06.png, 1779, 112, centigrade would have got off to a better 
Lines/b03/b03-098/b03-098-07.png, 1675, 132, start if they had taken more pains to 
Lines/b03/b03-098/b03-098-08.png, 1644, 126, explain the advantages to the general 
Lines/b03/b03-098/b03-098-09.png, 950, 100, public of the change . 
Lines/b03/b03-092/b03-092-00.png, 1595, 82, Comprehensive legislation is obviously preferable . They should not , 
Lines/b03/b03-092/b03-092-01.png, 1702, 89, however , disdain this opportunity of obtaining a useful sample of 
Lines/b03/b03-092/b03-092-02.png, 1713, 87, parliamentary opinion by at least allowing these Bills a fair run . 
Lines/b03/b03-092/b03-092-03.png, 1739, 90, Centigrade v. Fahrenheit . The fight is on . The challenger has behind 
Lines/b03/b03-092/b03-092-04.png, 1695, 83, it not only the authority of the SECRETARY of STATE for AIR 
Lines/b03/b03-092/b03-092-05.png, 1811, 82, but also the backing of the DIRECTOR GENERAL of the Meteoro- 
Lines/b03/b03-092/b03-092-06.png, 362, 80, logical Office . 
Lines/b03/b03-104/b03-104-00.png, 1799, 97, It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is 
Lines/b03/b03-104/b03-104-01.png, 1838, 130, at the moment " an awful mess up " in 
Lines/b03/b03-104/b03-104-02.png, 1891, 142, the measurement of temperatures . This , 
Lines/b03/b03-104/b03-104-03.png, 1984, 124, however , seems a matter of the convenience 
Lines/b03/b03-104/b03-104-04.png, 1846, 151, of specialists . The ordinary British man 
Lines/b03/b03-104/b03-104-05.png, 1979, 140, and woman is conscious of no difficulty . 
Lines/b03/b03-104/b03-104-06.png, 1831, 161, Rather than fifty million people having 
Lines/b03/b03-104/b03-104-07.png, 1959, 144, to be put out for the sake of 50,000 is there 
Lines/b03/b03-104/b03-104-08.png, 1994, 143, any reason why the centigrade countries 
Lines/b03/b03-104/b03-104-09.png, 1708, 154, should not change to fahrenheit ? 
Lines/b03/b03-114/b03-114-00.png, 1954, 136, In any case , fahrenheit need not lose heart . 
Lines/b03/b03-114/b03-114-01.png, 2036, 220, Once before , and that not so long ago , the 
Lines/b03/b03-114/b03-114-02.png, 1941, 157, authorities ganged up to alter the habits 
Lines/b03/b03-114/b03-114-03.png, 1824, 154, of the people . That effort was to enforce 
Lines/b03/b03-114/b03-114-04.png, 1999, 164, the adoption of the twenty-four hour 
Lines/b03/b03-114/b03-114-05.png, 1747, 141, clock . Then , also , the B.B.C. were 
Lines/b03/b03-114/b03-114-06.png, 1779, 153, roped in . The only result was 
Lines/b03/b03-114/b03-114-07.png, 1826, 191, that the well-meaning corporation 
Lines/b03/b03-114/b03-114-08.png, 1702, 204, became very unpopular . 
Lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-00.png, 1726, 163, Addressing the annual congress of the National Union 
Lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-01.png, 1725, 156, of General and Municipal Workers , he said he felt 
Lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-02.png, 1738, 130, sure the Labour movement was coming round in 
Lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-03.png, 1832, 142, support of his views . Obviously conscious of the fierce and 
Lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-04.png, 1760, 121, widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in 
Lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-05.png, 1860, 105, Britain , Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that 
Lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-06.png, 1935, 177, supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing 
Lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-07.png, 1736, 165, their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on 
Lines/a04/a04-047/a04-047-08.png, 502, 88, to the missile . 
Lines/a04/a04-015/a04-015-00.png, 1825, 118, The joint communique on Mr. Kennedy's and Mr. Macmillan's 
Lines/a04/a04-015/a04-015-01.png, 1771, 116, third talks - the first were at Key West , Florida , the second in 
Lines/a04/a04-015/a04-015-02.png, 1745, 129, Washington - said : " Their discussions covered the major problems , 
Lines/a04/a04-015/a04-015-03.png, 1712, 136, both economic and political , and revealed once again the 
Lines/a04/a04-015/a04-015-04.png, 1703, 149, close agreement of the two Governments in pursuing their 
Lines/a04/a04-015/a04-015-05.png, 1787, 145, common purposes . " Occasion was given to review the need for 
Lines/a04/a04-015/a04-015-06.png, 1767, 137, economic co-operation and expansion in the general interests 
Lines/a04/a04-015/a04-015-07.png, 1560, 147, of developed and underdeveloped countries alike . " 
Lines/a04/a04-006/a04-006-00.png, 1882, 141, Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Macmillan that he still 
Lines/a04/a04-006/a04-006-01.png, 2145, 147, wanted him to apply for membership of the Common 
Lines/a04/a04-006/a04-006-02.png, 2177, 125, Market , even if it meant an unconditional surrender . 
Lines/a04/a04-006/a04-006-03.png, 2020, 132, There were also brief discussions on Laos , Berlin 
Lines/a04/a04-006/a04-006-04.png, 2074, 165, and other foreign questions , after Mr. Kennedy had 
Lines/a04/a04-006/a04-006-05.png, 2024, 120, informed Mr. Macmillan of his discussions with Mr. 
Lines/a04/a04-006/a04-006-06.png, 2083, 135, Krushchov . With the exception of 40 minutes when 
Lines/a04/a04-006/a04-006-07.png, 1936, 151, Lord Home , Foreign Secretary , and Mr. McGeorge 
Lines/a04/a04-006/a04-006-08.png, 1831, 135, Bundy , the President's special assistant for 
Lines/a04/a04-006/a04-006-09.png, 1914, 148, security affairs , were brought in , the two 
Lines/a04/a04-006/a04-006-10.png, 869, 95, men talked alone . 
Lines/a04/a04-000/a04-000-00.png, 1856, 140, PRESIDENT KENNEDY renewed his pressure 
Lines/a04/a04-000/a04-000-01.png, 1599, 147, on Mr. Harold Macmillan to join the

Lines/a04/a04-000/a04-000-04.png, 1980, 129, three hours , 20 minutes of discussion is believed 
Lines/a04/a04-000/a04-000-05.png, 1796, 134, to have been devoted to this main point 
Lines/a04/a04-000/a04-000-06.png, 927, 168, of American policy . 
Lines/a04/a04-019/a04-019-00.png, 1740, 94, It said that the President and Premier noted " with satisfaction " the 
Lines/a04/a04-019/a04-019-01.png, 1703, 126, agreement in Vienna on the need for an effective Laos ceasefire , 
Lines/a04/a04-019/a04-019-02.png, 1651, 141, which should lead to progress toward a Laos agreement at the 
Lines/a04/a04-019/a04-019-03.png, 1743, 142, Geneva conference . " Particular attention was also given to the 
Lines/a04/a04-019/a04-019-04.png, 1786, 122, nuclear tests conference and to the question of disarmament . " The 
Lines/a04/a04-019/a04-019-05.png, 1781, 123, situation in regard to Germany was reviewed , and there was full 
Lines/a04/a04-019/a04-019-06.png, 1627, 140, agreement on the necessity of maintaining the rights and 
Lines/a04/a04-019/a04-019-07.png, 1473, 118, obligations of the allied Governments in Berlin . " 
Lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-00.png, 1752, 143, That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine . 
Lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-01.png, 1660, 137, So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons , 
Lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-02.png, 1650, 118, the West , somewhere , must have them too . It 
Lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-03.png, 1640, 154, was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory 
Lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-04.png, 1710, 148, purposes to be under the sea rather than on land . 
Lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-05.png, 1801, 172, This was why the Labour Party did not think it right 
Lines/a04/a04-054/a04-054-06.png, 1090, 174, to oppose the Polaris depot ship . 
Lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-00.png, 1690, 125, To Mr. Macmillan , Mr Gaitskell said the 
Lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-01.png, 1561, 140, Prime Minister should begin to take 
Lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-02.png, 1895, 175, seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear 
Lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-03.png, 1805, 198, weapons within the Nato alliance . " Let us say 
Lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-04.png, 1737, 163, to Macmillan that he should press , I hope 
Lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-05.png, 1679, 183, with the agreement of Kennedy , in 
Lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-06.png, 2074, 176, talks with the Soviet Union , for the establishment 
Lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-07.png, 1773, 186, in central Europe of a zone of controlled 
Lines/a04/a04-069/a04-069-08.png, 546, 101, disarmament . " 
Lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-00.png, 1607, 111, MR. GAITSKELL today delivered a full-blooded 
Lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-01.png, 1658, 90, defence of the Polaris missile base . And by 
Lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-02.png, 1604, 92, implication he supported the establishment of 
Lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-03.png, 1649, 129, sites in Britain for the training of German 
Lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-04.png, 1581, 90, troops . His main theme was that nuclear 
Lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-05.png, 1796, 89, weapons were necessary to defend Britain , that 
Lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-06.png, 1739, 95, Britain must depend on Nato and " the West " 
Lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-07.png, 1680, 79, must have nuclear weapons so long as the 
Lines/a04/a04-043/a04-043-08.png, 866, 77, Soviet Union has them . 
Lines/a04/a04-039/a04-039-00.png, 1621, 128, In VIENNA , before flying off to Moscow , 
Lines/a04/a04-039/a04-039-01.png, 1645, 110, Mr. Khrushchov said he hoped his weekend 
Lines/a04/a04-039/a04-039-02.png, 1652, 92, talks with President Kennedy would # help " to 
Lines/a04/a04-039/a04-039-03.png, 1636, 100, establish an enduring peace between nations . " 
Lines/a04/a04-039/a04-039-04.png, 1817, 102, Replying to a farewell speech from Austrian President 
Lines/a04/a04-039/a04-039-05.png, 1754, 97, Schaerf , the Soviet Premier thanked Austria for 
Lines/a04/a04-039/a04-039-06.png, 1694, 98, the hospitality and welcome he had received . 
Lines/a04/a04-039/a04-039-07.png, 1565, 89, " The Soviet Union has always striven and is 
Lines/a04/a04-039/a04-039-08.png, 1618, 91, striving to safeguard an enduring peace for 
Lines/a04/a04-039/a04-039-09.png, 1660, 94, the peoples , to secure an early solution of the 
Lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-00.png, 1523, 155, Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the 
Lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-01.png, 1480, 174, unilateralists was not possible , though 
Lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-02.png, 1712, 174, he respected their views . He saw by reports 
Lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-03.png, 1664, 159, that " those who organise these things " were 
Lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-04.png, 1826, 145, recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear 
Lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-05.png, 1632, 172, disarmament to shift the emphasis of 
Lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-06.png, 1887, 189, their intervention away from straight opposition 
Lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-07.png, 1808, 182, to the official document on to opposition 
Lines/a04/a04-066/a04-066-08.png, 777, 124, to the Polaris base . 
Lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-00.png, 1758, 165, He thought , he said , that the Soviet 
Lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-01.png, 1534, 145, Union would be prepared to reach 
Lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-02.png, 1706, 147, an agreement on a zone of controlled 
Lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-03.png, 1690, 113, disarmament in Europe . Mr Gaitskell 
Lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-04.png, 1633, 141, concluded , declaring that the present 
Lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-05.png, 1693, 121, was the beginning of a great period of 
Lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-06.png, 1610, 135, opportunity for the party . It was a 
Lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-07.png, 1655, 150, great chance that should be grasped . 
Lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-08.png, 1365, 187, Inter-union jealousies prevent the 
Lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-09.png, 1707, 186, fulfilment of a common policy for wages 
Lines/a04/a04-072/a04-072-10.png, 1707, 182, and other major questions , Mr. Jack Cooper

Lines/a04/a04-031/a04-031-03.png, 1746, 118, Kennedy , writes Dennis Ogden from Moscow . The 
Lines/a04/a04-031/a04-031-04.png, 1653, 102, good beginning made at Vienna must be 
Lines/a04/a04-031/a04-031-05.png, 1544, 115, followed up by new efforts for peace , the 
Lines/a04/a04-031/a04-031-06.png, 1542, 101, Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda 
Lines/a04/a04-031/a04-031-07.png, 1725, 101, declared yesterday . Events in Vienna " gave hope 
Lines/a04/a04-031/a04-031-08.png, 1648, 121, to people of goodwill who hate the cold war , 
Lines/a04/a04-031/a04-031-09.png, 1722, 92, and to all who are striving for a stable peace , " 
Lines/a04/a04-023/a04-023-00.png, 1792, 133, Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks , followed by lunch 
Lines/a04/a04-023/a04-023-01.png, 1838, 131, given by Lady Dorothy Macmillan with Mrs. Kennedy and other 
Lines/a04/a04-023/a04-023-02.png, 1768, 136, guests present , Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan met three more 
Lines/a04/a04-023/a04-023-03.png, 1802, 141, times yesterday . In PARIS , Mr. Dean Rusk , U.S. Secretary of 
Lines/a04/a04-023/a04-023-04.png, 1760, 136, State , gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the 
Lines/a04/a04-023/a04-023-05.png, 1662, 93, 15-nation Nato council . Some of his listeners said he was 
Lines/a04/a04-023/a04-023-06.png, 1864, 133, " rather pessimistic " and talked of a Berlin crisis later this year . 
Lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-00.png, 1401, 127, Suggesting that a total T.U.C. 
Lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-01.png, 1698, 127, membership of eight million was a " poor 
Lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-02.png, 1707, 122, show " compared with some countries , he 
Lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-03.png, 1860, 120, argued that the position needed examination . 
Lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-04.png, 1559, 120, BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr. 
Lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-05.png, 1746, 151, Macmillan yesterday morning he was given 
Lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-06.png, 1501, 84, the views of a wide section of the 
Lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-07.png, 1636, 133, British people about Polaris submarine 
Lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-08.png, 1565, 135, bases in this country . An open letter 
Lines/a04/a04-085/a04-085-09.png, 1714, 124, written by Earl Russell hoping that the 
Lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-00.png, 1838, 116, " Such retaliation might , and probably would , 
Lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-01.png, 1764, 126, destroy the whole population of Britain in 
Lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-02.png, 1768, 132, the course of , at the most , an hour " without 
Lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-03.png, 1840, 147, provoking American retaliation . Earl Russell 
Lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-04.png, 1799, 138, believes : " It is very questionable whether 
Lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-05.png, 1687, 125, British membership of Nato and British 
Lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-06.png, 1898, 115, permission of American bases on our territory 
Lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-07.png, 1829, 141, add anything to the strength of America , 
Lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-08.png, 1749, 144, while , on the contrary , they impose upon 
Lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-09.png, 1738, 110, America an onerous obligation which it 
Lines/a04/a04-099/a04-099-10.png, 1542, 119, may prove impossible to fulfil . " 
Lines/a04/a04-003/a04-003-00.png, 1586, 183, It arose during talks following 
Lines/a04/a04-003/a04-003-01.png, 1733, 158, President Kennedy's report to the British 
Lines/a04/a04-003/a04-003-02.png, 1794, 115, Prime Minister of the outcome of his recent 
Lines/a04/a04-003/a04-003-03.png, 1884, 153, visit to Paris . There General de Gaulle had made 
Lines/a04/a04-003/a04-003-04.png, 1789, 122, clear that he would accept Britain into the 
Lines/a04/a04-003/a04-003-05.png, 1986, 140, Common Market only if there were no conditions 
Lines/a04/a04-003/a04-003-06.png, 1817, 119, laid down to meet the Commonwealth 
Lines/a04/a04-003/a04-003-07.png, 1085, 102, and other reservations . 
Lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-00.png, 1692, 122, The third reason is that the supreme 
Lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-01.png, 1695, 111, interest for the whole world - East and 
Lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-02.png, 1700, 95, West and uncommitted nations - is the 
Lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-03.png, 1662, 152, prevention of nuclear war . " A rapidly 
Lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-04.png, 1721, 147, growing body of opinion in this country 
Lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-05.png, 1864, 98, believes that Britain could be more effective 
Lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-06.png, 1838, 150, in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral 
Lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-07.png, 1863, 132, by helping to suggest agreements which could 
Lines/a04/a04-103/a04-103-08.png, 1649, 118, be accepted by both East and West . " 
Lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-00.png, 1770, 140, There are three kinds of reasons that justify 
Lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-01.png, 1802, 136, the protests and these should carry weight with 
Lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-02.png, 1754, 131, the U.S. Government , Earl Russell suggested . " The 
Lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-03.png, 1784, 110, first of these reasons is the importance of pre- 
Lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-04.png, 1776, 115, serving the hitherto cordial relations between the 
Lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-05.png, 1793, 127, U.S. and Great Britain , not only in Government 
Lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-06.png, 1770, 128, circles , but in public opinion . " Earl Russell 
Lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-07.png, 1662, 133, says it is inevitable , though profoundly 
Lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-08.png, 1708, 131, regrettable , that the agitation against 
Lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-09.png, 1908, 124, the Polaris base has generated some antagonism 
Lines/a04/a04-092/a04-092-10.png, 1588, 122, to the policy of the United States . 
Lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-00.png, 1722, 85, The General Council of the Trades Union 
Lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-01.png, 1633, 114, Congress should therefore consider the 
Lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-02.png, 1768, 122, matter . Consideration should also be given 
Lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-03.png, 1629, 121, to the regrouping of unions and the 
Lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-04.png, 1612, 88, modification of their structures to 
Lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-05.png, 1661, 138, meet the growing concentration of 
Lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-06.png, 1519, 131, capital . Mr. Cooper argued that a 
Lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-07.png, 1553, 95, common industrial contribution was 
Lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-08.png, 1648, 140, urgent - particularly in unions serving 
Lines/a04/a04-081/a04-081-09.png, 1669, 132, workers in the same industry - along 
Lines/a04/a04-010/a04-010-00.png, 1954, 143, An attempt to get more information about the 
Lines/a04/a04-010/a04-010-01.png, 1797, 152, Admiralty House meeting will be made in the 
Lines/a04/a04-010/a04-010-02.png, 2103, 147, House of Commons this afternoon . Labour M.P.s already 
Lines/a04/a04-010/a04-010-03.png, 1992, 163, have many questions to the Prime Minister asking 
Lines/a04/a04-010/a04-010-04.png, 2090, 187, for a statement . President Kennedy flew from London 
Lines/a04/a04-010/a04-010-05.png, 1886, 177, Airport last night to arrive in Washington this 
Lines/a04/a04-010/a04-010-06.png, 2112, 151, morning . He is to make a 30-minute nation-wide 
Lines/a04/a04-010/a04-010-07.png, 1787, 140, broadcast and television report on his 
Lines/a04/a04-010/a04-010-08.png, 1874, 154, talks with Mr. Krushchov this evening . 
Lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-00.png, 1769, 105, The second reason is concerned with doubts 
Lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-01.png, 1864, 142, as to the safety of the people of Great Britain ; 
Lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-02.png, 1752, 112, " in the time of crisis it would probably be 
Lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-03.png, 1687, 129, impossible for the British authorities to 
Lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-04.png, 1799, 129, exercise any degree of control over the action 
Lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-05.png, 1710, 125, of Polaris submarines . " He argues that 
Lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-06.png, 1817, 145, there is a distinct possibility that so long 
Lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-07.png, 1747, 96, as there is a Polaris base in Britain the 
Lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-08.png, 1631, 133, Soviet Union might retaliate against 
Lines/a04/a04-096/a04-096-09.png, 629, 91, Britain alone . 
Lines/a04/a04-050/a04-050-00.png, 1703, 173, Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could

Lines/a04/a04-027/a04-027-05.png, 1795, 127, but no big changes should be expected in the political situation .

Lines/n04/n04-068/n04-068-02.png, 1737, 122, inherited desire to snub the man . If he did he 
Lines/n04/n04-068/n04-068-03.png, 1817, 116, would have to leave the bar and either sit in 
Lines/n04/n04-068/n04-068-04.png, 1576, 118, the lounge or return to his bedroom . 
Lines/n04/n04-068/n04-068-05.png, 1753, 100, Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and 
Lines/n04/n04-068/n04-068-06.png, 1803, 126, came to the rescue . " You haven't introduced

Lines/n04/n04-048/n04-048-00.png, 1617, 112, So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head , that

Lines/n04/n04-048/n04-048-05.png, 1656, 106, went in search of a drink . The lower bar was 
Lines/n04/n04-048/n04-048-06.png, 1786, 136, empty , save for the lady known by all habitue

Lines/n04/n04-107/n04-107-03.png, 1763, 149, found him curiously stimulating . " You 're a 
Lines/n04/n04-107/n04-107-04.png, 1679, 112, bit of a humorist , aren't you ? " said 
Lines/n04/n04-107/n04-107-05.png, 1796, 149, Bawley . " The truth is usually very embarra-

Lines/n04/n04-156/n04-156-02.png, 1755, 243, Bawley was a man of his word . He kept

Lines/n04/n04-156/n04-156-04.png, 1829, 158, host and a splendid raconteur . The evening 
Lines/n04/n04-156/n04-156-05.png, 1747, 191, passed all too quickly . As they parted in 
Lines/n04/n04-156/n04-156-06.png, 1568, 107, the vestibule the two men were well 
Lines/n04/n04-156/n04-156-07.png, 1279, 161, disposed towards each other .

Lines/n04/n04-075/n04-075-05.png, 1663, 130, to you ? " It did . Ian Bawley's name was 
Lines/n04/n04-075/n04-075-06.png, 1722, 137, printed at the head of most naval articles

Lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-00.png, 1771, 131, John's father had been a naval officer of the old 
Lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-01.png, 1751, 121, school ; some of his rigid ideas had been passed 
Lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-02.png, 1827, 127, on to the second generation . One of these was that 
Lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-03.png, 1746, 136, an officer should join a ship , on taking up a 
Lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-04.png, 1802, 121, new appointment , at nine a.m. precisely , dressed 
Lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-05.png, 1829, 115, in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword . 
Lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-06.png, 1770, 116, It would have been acceptable to all concerned 
Lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-07.png, 1799, 115, if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in 
Lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-08.png, 1716, 131, plain-clothes on the previous night , but ways 
Lines/n04/n04-044/n04-044-09.png, 1684, 131, instilled by martinet parents have a habit of

Lines/n04/n04-084/n04-084-03.png, 1666, 127, otherwise than take it . " Pleased to meet you , 
Lines/n04/n04-084/n04-084-04.png, 1693, 98, Commander , " he said . " Now what about that 
Lines/n04/n04-084/n04-084-05.png, 1813, 125, drink ? " John nodded - he could afford to buy 
Lines/n04/n04-084/n04-084-06.png, 1254, 137, one in return and he was lonely . 
Lines/n04/n04-209/n04-209-00.png, 1690, 107, A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in 
Lines/n04/n04-209/n04-209-01.png, 1624, 106, through the open windows of the Captain's house . It 
Lines/n04/n04-209/n04-209-02.png, 1788, 122, pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine 
Lines/n04/n04-209/n04-209-03.png, 1777, 119, Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over 
Lines/n04/n04-209/n04-209-04.png, 1650, 116, a substantial breakfast . Although usually a very 
Lines/n04/n04-209/n04-209-05.png, 1698, 119, talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's 
Lines/n04/n04-209/n04-209-06.png, 1725, 113, silences , for she knew they betokened a worry of 
Lines/n04/n04-209/n04-209-07.png, 345, 72, some sort . 
Lines/n04/n04-130/n04-130-00.png, 1852, 166, John flushed . " I 'm not in need of charity . " " Come 
Lines/n04/n04-130/n04-130-01.png, 1753, 166, off it , " said Bawley . " The proprietor of the Daily 
Lines/n04/n04-130/n04-130-02.png, 1806, 190, Courier knows what 's going on . If he doesn't mind , 
Lines/n04/n04-130/n04-130-03.png, 1615, 183, why should you ? " " I see . " John took the 
Lines/n04/n04-130/n04-130-04.png, 1688, 209, refilled glass and looked over the rim at his 
Lines/n04/n04-130/n04-130-05.png, 1800, 162, companion . " You want me to talk , is that it ? " 
Lines/n04/n04-163/n04-163-00.png, 1793, 189, " Ever been to Fleet Street ? " asked Bawley . 
Lines/n04/n04-163/n04-163-01.png, 1615, 233, " You should . Next time you 're in Town 
Lines/n04/n04-163/n04-163-02.png, 1745, 200, give me a ring at this number and I 'll 
Lines/n04/n04-163/n04-163-03.png, 1740, 180, take you round the pubs where most 
Lines/n04/n04-163/n04-163-04.png, 1730, 158, of the work is done . " He held out a card . 
Lines/n04/n04-163/n04-163-05.png, 1683, 176, John took it and put it in his pocket . 
Lines/n04/n04-163/n04-163-06.png, 1676, 180, " Thanks , " he said . " If ever my missus 
Lines/n04/n04-163/n04-163-07.png, 1507, 189, lets me off the chain I 'll take you 
Lines/n04/n04-163/n04-163-08.png, 471, 164, up on that . 
Lines/n04/n04-015/n04-015-00.png, 1776, 93, A submariner's wife needed to be spared as much 
Lines/n04/n04-015/n04-015-01.png, 1757, 112, as possible . Anyway the Parsifal affair was far 
Lines/n04/n04-015/n04-015-02.png, 1739, 109, too fresh in both their minds to be a comfortable 
Lines/n04/n04-015/n04-015-03.png, 1781, 105, subject for discussion . " It 's a command , " he said . 
Lines/n04/n04-015/n04-015-04.png, 1807, 124, We can do with the extra money . It 'll just about 
Lines/n04/n04-015/n04-015-05.png, 1636, 120, pay Jacky's school fees . " " What shall we do 
Lines/n04/n04-015/n04-015-06.png, 1820, 117, about this house ? - and Jill's school ? - and oh ! 
Lines/n04/n04-015/n04-015-07.png, 798, 127, how I hate the Navy ! 
Lines/n04/n04-171/n04-171-00.png, 1663, 107, Ever been out in a submarine ? I 'll give 
Lines/n04/n04-171/n04-171-01.png, 1627, 112, you a spin round one of these days , if you 
Lines/n04/n04-171/n04-171-02.png, 1874, 121, like . You could write it up . " Bawley made a face . 
Lines/n04/n04-171/n04-171-03.png, 1589, 122, " Not in Pericles , old man . " " Why not ? " 
Lines/n04/n04-171/n04-171-04.png, 1772, 134, " Better ask Robbie Munyard . " " What 's he been 
Lines/n04/n04-171/n04-171-05.png, 1812, 132, saying ? " John was furious . The little squirt ! 
Lines/n04/n04-171/n04-171-06.png, 1374, 131, To go gassing to a newspaper man ! 
Lines/n04/n04-139/n04-139-00.png, 1744, 178, " You misjudge me , " said Bawley . " You have 
Lines/n04/n04-139/n04-139-01.png, 1843, 179, nothing to tell me , yet . But we 'll be meeting 
Lines/n04/n04-139/n04-139-02.png, 1702, 289, again , no doubt , and then you will have . 
Lines/n04/n04-139/n04-139-03.png, 1662, 201, Regard this as a softening-up process , and 
Lines/n04/n04-139/n04-139-04.png, 1690, 144, have dinner with me ? On His Lordship , 
Lines/n04/n04-139/n04-139-05.png, 1646, 198, of course . " " On one condition , " said John . 
Lines/n04/n04-139/n04-139-06.png, 1759, 145, " Tell me who the little bird was . " " Can't 
Lines/n04/n04-139/n04-139-07.png, 1821, 223, you guess ? Whose portrait appears regularly 
Lines/n04/n04-139/n04-139-08.png, 968, 177, in the shiny papers ? " 
Lines/n04/n04-092/n04-092-00.png, 1813, 123, " For the sake of accuracy , " he said , " and I 
Lines/n04/n04-092/n04-092-01.png, 1736, 134, know how you newspaper people value that commodity ! - 
Lines/n04/n04-092/n04-092-02.png, 1785, 111, please don't address me as Commander . I 'm 
Lines/n04/n04-092/n04-092-03.png, 1700, 139, a Lieutenant-Commander . Perhaps we could 
Lines/n04/n04-092/n04-092-04.png, 1743, 116, drop the rank - such a mouthful ! " " You 're 
Lines/n04/n04-092/n04-092-05.png, 1818, 139, absolutely right , " said Bawley , as he pushed over 
Lines/n04/n04-092/n04-092-06.png, 1736, 136, his glass . " Fill it up , darling . Accuracy above 
Lines/n04/n04-092/n04-092-07.png, 1752, 127, all else . We pride ourselves about accuracy on 
Lines/n04/n04-092/n04-092-08.png, 446, 72, the Courier . 
Lines/n04/n04-009/n04-009-00.png, 1583, 120, " That little beast Robbie Munyard spent six 
Lines/n04/n04-009/n04-009-01.png, 1628, 109, months ashore while Pericles was refitting in the 
Lines/n04/n04-009/n04-009-02.png, 1759, 119, dockyard and now that she 's ready for sea he goes 
Lines/n04/n04-009/n04-009-03.png, 1614, 118, sick . Just because he 's an Honourable he can do 
Lines/n04/n04-009/n04-009-04.png, 1766, 124, what he likes . Anyway , why pick on you to succeed 
Lines/n04/n04-009/n04-009-05.png, 1646, 97, him ? " John didn't answer . There was no point 
Lines/n04/n04-009/n04-009-06.png, 1352, 114, in sharing his discomfort with Peggy . 
Lines/n04/n04-039/n04-039-00.png, 1683, 150, That little beast , Robbie Munyard ! " Having 
Lines/n04/n04-039/n04-039-01.png, 1789, 125, said her say Peggy manfully shouldered her 
Lines/n04/n04-039/n04-039-02.png, 1777, 118, burden and prepared to break up yet 
Lines/n04/n04-039/n04-039-03.png, 1767, 124, another home . In the ten years of married life 
Lines/n04/n04-039/n04-039-04.png, 1883, 135, this had already happened half a dozen times . 
Lines/n04/n04-039/n04-039-05.png, 1723, 131, Such is the life of a naval officer's wife . 
Lines/n04/n04-031/n04-031-00.png, 1733, 123, Practically a shore job . Cheer up . " She wiped 
Lines/n04/n04-031/n04-031-01.png, 1786, 121, her eyes and reached for her address book . " I 'll 
Lines/n04/n04-031/n04-031-02.png, 1720, 118, write to those agents and try to get a flat in

Lines/n04/n04-031/n04-031-04.png, 1756, 129, Jill will say about leaving her school . It 's a

Lines/n04/n04-031/n04-031-06.png, 1683, 121, And all the trouble you 've taken with the 
Lines/n04/n04-031/n04-031-07.png, 296, 139, garden ! 
Lines/n04/n04-052/n04-052-00.png, 1634, 121, Seaweed's memory was prodigious ; her manner 
Lines/n04/n04-052/n04-052-01.png, 1783, 119, must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors 
Lines/n04/n04-052/n04-052-02.png, 1729, 130, of the hotel . She greeted John , however , with less 
Lines/n04/n04-052/n04-052-03.png, 1837, 126, than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning 
Lines/n04/n04-052/n04-052-04.png, 1711, 123, glance at him . Evidently the other occupant 
Lines/n04/n04-052/n04-052-05.png, 1681, 135, of the bar was not 6persona grata . If her 
Lines/n04/n04-052/n04-052-06.png, 1588, 131, memory was good , so was this stranger's . 
Lines/n04/n04-052/n04-052-07.png, 1765, 120, " You 're Commander Winter , " he said . " Have a 
Lines/n04/n04-052/n04-052-08.png, 1228, 125, gin ? " He turned to Seaweed - 
Lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-00.png, 1777, 116, This is the testing time for all . The affair blows up into 
Lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-01.png, 1684, 80, a national disaster and then when it is all over life 
Lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-02.png, 1804, 106, must continue as before . During this period the Captain 
Lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-03.png, 1823, 100, must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as 
Lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-04.png, 1778, 107, if nothing unusual has happened . Harry Turton had 
Lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-05.png, 1745, 99, written letters to the bereaved , had visited many in the 
Lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-06.png, 1839, 116, locality , had been interviewed by the Press , had driven 
Lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-07.png, 1761, 113, his surviving submarines a good deal harder than 
Lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-08.png, 1836, 102, usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics 
Lines/n04/n04-218/n04-218-09.png, 919, 92, suitable for such occasions . 
Lines/n04/n04-100/n04-100-00.png, 1770, 117, Ever known us bowl a wide about your Service ? 
Lines/n04/n04-100/n04-100-01.png, 1824, 148, Check and counter-check - nothing but the truth . 
Lines/n04/n04-100/n04-100-02.png, 1727, 143, Somewhat embarrassing , what ? " " How can the 
Lines/n04/n04-100/n04-100-03.png, 1843, 139, truth be embarrassing ? " John sipped his double 
Lines/n04/n04-100/n04-100-04.png, 1897, 126, gin with relish . It was his favourite brand , 
Lines/n04/n04-100/n04-100-05.png, 1862, 129, he was on the verge of a new chapter in 
Lines/n04/n04-100/n04-100-06.png, 1855, 118, his career , and his companion's attitude was 
Lines/n04/n04-100/n04-100-07.png, 444, 126, challenging . 
Lines/n04/n04-000/n04-000-00.png, 1801, 122, Bertram's face was grim . " You think it was the Snort , 
Lines/n04/n04-000/n04-000-01.png, 1751, 114, don't you ? " John gave a short laugh . " I did , " he 
Lines/n04/n04-000/n04-000-02.png, 1638, 118, said ; " but I 'd better stop thinking that now . 
Lines/n04/n04-000/n04-000-03.png, 1767, 116, Pericles is fitted with an identically similar one . " 
Lines/n04/n04-000/n04-000-04.png, 1621, 127, " So there you are , my dear . " Peggy 's eyes filled 
Lines/n04/n04-000/n04-000-05.png, 1280, 92, with tears . " It 's so unfair , " she said . 
Lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-00.png, 1762, 125, There had been many such breakfasts lately since the 
Lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-01.png, 1823, 126, affair of Parsifal . Harry had lost a good deal of weight . 
Lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-02.png, 1771, 121, His normal placid and steady-going manner remained , 
Lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-03.png, 1752, 117, but she could see that it no longer came naturally . 
Lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-04.png, 1794, 120, It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers 
Lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-05.png, 1941, 96, to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine , 
Lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-06.png, 1760, 119, though in peace time these happenings are few and 
Lines/n04/n04-213/n04-213-07.png, 414, 98, far between . 
Lines/m04/m04-007/m04-007-00.png, 1876, 129, And a fine old fuss there was about it , too . 
Lines/m04/m04-007/m04-007-01.png, 1844, 126, Here are the known facts . On 10th July , 
Lines/m04/m04-007/m04-007-02.png, 1868, 142, the bus , the 2.20 from Dinas to Llangrwl , 
Lines/m04/m04-007/m04-007-03.png, 1799, 124, left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual . 
Lines/m04/m04-007/m04-007-04.png, 1913, 127, Aboard , apart from the crew , were Mrs. Megan 
Lines/m04/m04-007/m04-007-05.png, 1999, 130, Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader ; 
Lines/m04/m04-007/m04-007-06.png, 1993, 140, pretty little Morfydd Owen ; Mr. Stanley Hayball 
Lines/m04/m04-007/m04-007-07.png, 1819, 135, and Miss Ethel Yates , hikers from 
Lines/m04/m04-007/m04-007-08.png, 1866, 147, Birmingham ; Price the Provisions ; and the 
Lines/m04/m04-007/m04-007-09.png, 580, 107, Rev. Edwards . 
Lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-00.png, 1863, 143, Where indeed ? Megan Thomas spoke sharply 
Lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-01.png, 1942, 154, to the conductor , demanding an explanation . 
Lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-02.png, 1743, 124, But nonplussed , the conductor was . A 
Lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-03.png, 1871, 149, good man , mind ; knew his job . But out of 
Lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-04.png, 1862, 136, depth in this particular instance . Fingered 
Lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-05.png, 1804, 123, his ticket-punch nervously . Peered out of 
Lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-06.png, 1916, 96, the window . Went and consulted the driver . 
Lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-07.png, 1975, 163, " Where are we going ? " he echoed Cadwallader . 
Lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-08.png, 1826, 123, " Damned if I know , boy , " said the driver . 
Lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-09.png, 1592, 144, " But something very untoward has 
Lines/m04/m04-081/m04-081-10.png, 1207, 100, happened , if you ask me . " 
Lines/m04/m04-030/m04-030-00.png, 1507, 135, " Good-bye , Dai , " said Morfydd , smiling from the bottom step . 
Lines/m04/m04-030/m04-030-01.png, 1924, 140, " Good-bye , Morfydd . " He sought to enfold her in his arms . But he was too late . 
Lines/m04/m04-030/m04-030-02.png, 1911, 142, She was already up the bus steps , and the bus was away . And Morfydd Owen 
Lines/m04/m04-030/m04-030-03.png, 1936, 168, waving , unkissed , from the window . And Dai , on the pavement , knowing in his 
Lines/m04/m04-030/m04-030-04.png, 1866, 181, heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas . 
Lines/m04/m04-251/m04-251-00.png, 1727, 105, " Then we are saved , " cried the Rev. Edwards . 
Lines/m04/m04-251/m04-251-01.png, 1426, 109, Shyly , Morfydd Owen produced a block of 
Lines/m04/m04-251/m04-251-02.png, 315, 86, chocolate . 
Lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-00.png, 1764, 140, They looked at him , sullen . His heart 
Lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-01.png, 1871, 111, sank . If the Welsh found the situation 
Lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-02.png, 1772, 130, too desperate for singing , then the 
Lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-03.png, 1935, 103, situation , he realised , must be desperate 
Lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-04.png, 1901, 125, indeed . But suddenly they were roused 
Lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-05.png, 1833, 135, from their lethargy . Something was 
Lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-06.png, 1866, 137, approaching , faster , faster , a tearing 
Lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-07.png, 1914, 129, hurrying blur that was past and gone 
Lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-08.png, 1734, 111, in a moment , followed by a great 
Lines/m04/m04-138/m04-138-09.png, 2000, 133, rush of sound . They waved frantically . 
Lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-00.png, 1720, 147, " Do as I say , driver . " Very stern , the reverend 
Lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-01.png, 1549, 127, gentleman was . So the driver peep-peeped as 
Lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-02.png, 1547, 115, through empty space . " Thank you , " the Rev. 
Lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-03.png, 1713, 106, Edwards said courteously . " Secondly , we must 
Lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-04.png, 1677, 108, pool and ration our supplies of food , if any . " 
Lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-05.png, 1741, 114, He looked at Price the Provisions , who was nursing 
Lines/m04/m04-231/m04-231-06.png, 571, 115, a great basket . 
Lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-00.png, 1756, 90, But losing a bus ! People were always losing 
Lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-01.png, 1731, 89, things . You 'd be surprised , they said . So it 
Lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-02.png, 1757, 72, seemed , for a time , that the whole affair would 
Lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-03.png, 1641, 75, be written off as one of those unexplained 
Lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-04.png, 1692, 93, mysteries , like the Marie Celeste . Then things 
Lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-05.png, 1858, 87, began to happen ... But what about the voyagers ? 
Lines/m04/m04-209/m04-209-06.png, 855, 86, you will be asking . 
Lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-00.png, 1751, 79, Well , the Rev. Edwards had taken command . " Our 
Lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-01.png, 1754, 96, position , " he said , " is somewhat analogous to 
Lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-02.png, 1783, 91, that of a castaway on a desert island . Now 
Lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-03.png, 1680, 92, what does such a person do ? He signals 
Lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-04.png, 1705, 87, his position by lighting bonfires or hoisting a 
Lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-05.png, 1749, 77, flag on a palm tree . And he tries to ensure 
Lines/m04/m04-216/m04-216-06.png, 653, 74, a supply of food . " 
Lines/m04/m04-038/m04-038-00.png, 1870, 156, So the bus set out for Llangrwl . But it never reached there ! Somewhere , 
Lines/m04/m04-038/m04-038-01.png, 1918, 178, on those fifteen miles of mountain roads , it disappeared from the earthly 
Lines/m04/m04-038/m04-038-02.png, 1712, 121, scene . The first intimation that all was not well came when a 
Lines/m04/m04-038/m04-038-03.png, 1810, 174, Mr. Isaiah Roberts , landlord of The Traveller's Joy , rang up the 
Lines/m04/m04-038/m04-038-04.png, 1722, 145, Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their 
Lines/m04/m04-038/m04-038-05.png, 322, 82, damn bus . 
Lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-00.png, 1601, 135, Dai , meanwhile , was pedalling 
Lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-01.png, 1863, 144, furiously on the road . Not a sign of 
Lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-02.png, 1772, 125, the bus . He passed The Traveller's 
Lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-03.png, 1814, 142, Joy . At last he caught up Mr. Roberts , 
Lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-04.png, 1933, 137, walking very dogged towards Llangrwl . 
Lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-05.png, 1951, 116, " Afternoon , Mr. Roberts , " he called , polite , 
Lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-06.png, 1898, 126, as he shot past . His spirits were rising . 
Lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-07.png, 1709, 130, He had seen no sign of an accident . 
Lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-08.png, 2043, 114, Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken . 
Lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-09.png, 1921, 118, He would find the bus safe and sound in 
Lines/m04/m04-113/m04-113-10.png, 1871, 131, Llangrwl , and his dear Morfydd quietly 
Lines/m04/m04-012/m04-012-00.png, 1809, 110, Yes , the bus set out from Dinas . So much 
Lines/m04/m04-012/m04-012-01.png, 1821, 120, is established . Ifor Huw Evans , Propr. , 
Lines/m04/m04-012/m04-012-02.png, 1827, 142, watched it go from the windows of the 
Lines/m04/m04-012/m04-012-03.png, 1888, 122, Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. Very interested , 
Lines/m04/m04-012/m04-012-04.png, 1801, 136, Ifor was . For there was his garage hand , 
Lines/m04/m04-012/m04-012-05.png, 1792, 147, Dai Pugh , taking a tearful farewell of 
Lines/m04/m04-012/m04-012-06.png, 1833, 157, Morfydd Owen . Morfydd , who had until 
Lines/m04/m04-012/m04-012-07.png, 1736, 140, recently been Ifor's typist , but was now 
Lines/m04/m04-012/m04-012-08.png, 1650, 138, returning to her home town as a 
Lines/m04/m04-012/m04-012-09.png, 1337, 151, fully-fledged schoolteacher . 
Lines/m04/m04-238/m04-238-00.png, 1564, 146, " Now , who has any food ? " he asked hopefully . 
Lines/m04/m04-238/m04-238-01.png, 1654, 126, Stared back did Price the Provisions , unwinking . 
Lines/m04/m04-238/m04-238-02.png, 1753, 122, " Mr. Price , I think you may be able to help us here , " 
Lines/m04/m04-238/m04-238-03.png, 1564, 71, said the Rev. Edwards . Price shook his head . 
Lines/m04/m04-238/m04-238-04.png, 1686, 119, " Intended for Plas Newydd , this lot is . Paid for , 
Lines/m04/m04-238/m04-238-05.png, 1800, 116, too . " He folded his arms protectively over the basket . 
Lines/m04/m04-061/m04-061-00.png, 1913, 165, " And what are you going to do about it ? " Tendentious , Mr. Roberts sounded . 
Lines/m04/m04-061/m04-061-01.png, 1874, 129, " What do you want me to do ? Send out a sheriff's posse , is it ? " No sense 
Lines/m04/m04-061/m04-061-02.png, 1884, 161, of humour , that Isaiah . He banged down the receiver . Very uncivil . Dropped 
Lines/m04/m04-061/m04-061-03.png, 1827, 150, the mask , now , Ifor did . " Dai Pugh , " he bellowed . " Leap on your bicycle 
Lines/m04/m04-061/m04-061-04.png, 1584, 148, and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller's Joy . 
Lines/m04/m04-043/m04-043-00.png, 1715, 166, " Left here all right , " said Ifor . " Two-thirty-five , on the dot . " " It 's 
Lines/m04/m04-043/m04-043-01.png, 1821, 163, supposed to leave at two-twenty . " " Who says so ? " " Your timetable . " 
Lines/m04/m04-043/m04-043-02.png, 1875, 132, " Don't want to take too much notice of those old timetables , " Ifor said , 
Lines/m04/m04-043/m04-043-03.png, 1830, 175, reasonably . " Start running punctual and where are you ? People get 
Lines/m04/m04-043/m04-043-04.png, 1645, 154, left behind , isn't it ? Very exasperating for one and all . " 
Lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-00.png, 1941, 89, He saluted , and left the presence , very crestfallen ... 
Lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-01.png, 1888, 91, Time passed . The bus climbed , and went quietly 
Lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-02.png, 1865, 101, into orbit . Time passed . The Rev. Edwards' pulpit 
Lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-03.png, 1813, 97, remained empty . And so did the arms of Dai 
Lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-04.png, 1827, 96, Pugh . How could they be otherwise , when his 
Lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-05.png, 1831, 96, beloved was circling the Poles at three-and-a- 
Lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-06.png, 1711, 94, quarter-hour intervals , regular as clockwork ? 
Lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-07.png, 1713, 109, Time passed . Everyone said , " Pity about Megan 
Lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-08.png, 1851, 96, Thomas , isn't it , " as though they didn't really think 
Lines/m04/m04-190/m04-190-09.png, 1745, 97, it was a pity at all ; as , indeed , they didn't . 
Lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-00.png, 1750, 92, Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser , was the 
Lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-01.png, 1727, 119, Rev. Edwards . Now he put down his paper , 
Lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-02.png, 1643, 143, folded it , and glanced idly out of the 
Lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-03.png, 1855, 142, window . Looked again , eyes starting from 
Lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-04.png, 1903, 124, his head . " God bless my immortal soul , " 
Lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-05.png, 1808, 126, he cried . " Never mind your immortal 
Lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-06.png, 1656, 151, soul , " said Megan Thomas tartly . 
Lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-07.png, 1852, 136, " Here we are traversing the heavens at the 
Lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-08.png, 1592, 110, very moment when we should be 
Lines/m04/m04-093/m04-093-09.png, 1755, 152, running into Llangrwl bus station . 
Lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-00.png, 1833, 123, But disappointment awaited him . A 
Lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-01.png, 1960, 115, restive queue of people in the bus station , 
Lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-02.png, 1916, 137, waiting to be transported to Dinas . And 
Lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-03.png, 1852, 123, when he went to Morfydd's house , all 
Lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-04.png, 1890, 141, he found was Morfydd's mam , working 
Lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-05.png, 1853, 128, herself up proper ... Getting dark , now . 
Lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-06.png, 1788, 120, The conductor switched on the lights . 
Lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-07.png, 1848, 136, The beleaguered passengers peered out of 
Lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-08.png, 1842, 122, the windows . Little to be seen , only a 
Lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-09.png, 1811, 115, few lone stars , and the distant earth 
Lines/m04/m04-123/m04-123-10.png, 1584, 127, brooding in her shroud of mist . 
Lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-00.png, 1808, 149, But even his imagination , luckily for him , 
Lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-01.png, 1653, 106, did not visualise the awful truth - that 
Lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-02.png, 1803, 164, Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for 
Lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-03.png, 1855, 120, the title of " First Woman to Enter Space . " 
Lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-04.png, 1881, 164, " Where are we going , Mam ? " inquired little 
Lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-05.png, 1840, 157, Cadwallader when his child mind grasped 
Lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-06.png, 1770, 161, the fact that the green earth was falling 
Lines/m04/m04-078/m04-078-07.png, 1292, 121, away at a rate of knots . 
Lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-00.png, 1779, 95, LOCAL BUS DISAPPEARS announced the 
Lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-01.png, 1905, 103, Dinas Advertiser . But the London papers ignored 
Lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-02.png, 1771, 91, the whole affair . Ifor Evans reported his loss 
Lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-03.png, 1745, 84, to the police . But they only tut-tutted . " Lost 
Lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-04.png, 1667, 100, a bus , is it . Very careless . " That was their 
Lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-05.png, 1903, 84, attitude . Now if there 'd been a good old accident , 
Lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-06.png, 1652, 91, they could have measured up the road and 
Lines/m04/m04-200/m04-200-07.png, 672, 63, taken an interest . 
Lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-00.png, 1809, 117, " But I 'm only going fifteen miles away , " 
Lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-01.png, 1701, 140, Morfydd was saying . " Not the end of 
Lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-02.png, 1747, 139, the world , is it ? " " For me it is , " Dai 
Lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-03.png, 1848, 140, said wretchedly , wiping his hands on his 
Lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-04.png, 1759, 137, overalls preparatory to a last embrace . " You 
Lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-05.png, 1674, 123, will not be remembering a mere garage 
Lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-06.png, 1682, 138, hand when you are lording it over 
Lines/m04/m04-019/m04-019-07.png, 1712, 158, the Mixed Infants of Llangrwl . " 
Lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-00.png, 1629, 123, They 'd got the lights on . There were people inside . 
Lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-01.png, 1673, 121, Waving . " Like gimlets , the Station Commander's eyes . 
Lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-02.png, 1672, 114, " Did you see the indicator board ? " " Yes , sir . " " And 
Lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-03.png, 1839, 125, what did it say ? Mystery Tour ? " Oh , very caustic , that 
Lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-04.png, 1800, 109, Group Captain . But Broughtons stood his ground . " No , 
Lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-05.png, 1773, 111, sir . It said Llangrwl . " Llewelyn Jones sat 
Lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-06.png, 1736, 121, back in his chair . " I see . So you met a bus at 
Lines/m04/m04-164/m04-164-07.png, 723, 122, fifty thousand feet . 
Lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-00.png, 1926, 144, Megan Thomas sat tight-lipped , nursing 
Lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-01.png, 1762, 128, the sleeping Cadwallader . Driver and 
Lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-02.png, 1983, 112, conductor peered ahead into nothingness . 
Lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-03.png, 1958, 113, On the back seat Stan Hayball embraced 
Lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-04.png, 1805, 114, his Eth . Morfydd thought of Dai . The 
Lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-05.png, 1781, 132, Rev. Edwards , standing at the front , 
Lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-06.png, 1695, 116, looked at his forlorn flock . " What 
Lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-07.png, 1991, 119, about a verse or two of Cwm Rhondda ? " 
Lines/m04/m04-131/m04-131-08.png, 1158, 138, he suggested hopefully . 
Lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-00.png, 1886, 159, And no one doing the first thing about 
Lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-01.png, 1896, 161, it . " Stung , the conductor was . " What you 
Lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-02.png, 1792, 173, expect me to do ? " he inquired , bitter . 
Lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-03.png, 1816, 160, " Radio Flying Control at London Airport , 
Lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-04.png, 1893, 137, is it ? " " Mutual recriminations will get 
Lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-05.png, 1851, 102, us nowhere , " boomed the Rev. Edwards . 
Lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-06.png, 1643, 108, " It 's all very well , " commented 
Lines/m04/m04-100/m04-100-07.png, 1679, 117, Mr. Hayball from the back seat . 
Lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-00.png, 1717, 108, " Can't go lighting bonfires on this bus , " 
Lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-01.png, 1678, 87, the conductor said firmly . " Contrary to the 
Lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-02.png, 1742, 97, Company's Regulations . " " Of course not , " agreed 
Lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-03.png, 1858, 99, the minister . " No , we have another way of signalling 
Lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-04.png, 1687, 75, our position . The driver must sound his horn 
Lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-05.png, 1677, 87, continuously . " Gave him a look , the driver did . 
Lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-06.png, 1617, 100, " Where you think we are ? " he asked rudely . 
Lines/m04/m04-222/m04-222-07.png, 828, 99, " Dinas High Street ? " 
Lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-00.png, 1667, 144, " Silly boy , " said Morfydd . Though she 
Lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-01.png, 1876, 127, could not help wondering whether , now she 
Lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-02.png, 1858, 121, had qualified as a schoolteacher , poor 
Lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-03.png, 1857, 147, little Dai was quite the man for her . 
Lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-04.png, 1892, 143, A nice boy of course . But perhaps in the 
Lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-05.png, 1932, 138, new world she was entering there might 
Lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-06.png, 1960, 139, be boys equally nice , and with far more 
Lines/m04/m04-024/m04-024-07.png, 1820, 145, to offer . The conductor rang his bell . 
Lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-00.png, 1729, 98, " But Eth and me wanted to be 
Lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-01.png, 1690, 142, at the Youth Hostel before dark . " 
Lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-02.png, 1716, 138, Morfydd Owen was silent . But she 
Lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-03.png, 1939, 152, looked down at the fast-disappearing 
Lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-04.png, 1836, 106, earth , and it seemed to her that she 
Lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-05.png, 1810, 149, would never see her Dai again . And 
Lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-06.png, 1794, 138, though half an hour ago she had 
Lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-07.png, 1603, 134, regarded this possibility with 
Lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-08.png, 1770, 133, fortitude , it now filled her with 
Lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-09.png, 1627, 151, dismay . Quietly she began to 
Lines/m04/m04-107/m04-107-10.png, 404, 94, weep ... 
Lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-00.png, 1640, 150, The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to 
Lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-01.png, 1801, 110, complete her mission . " Paled , did Dai . For the 
Lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-02.png, 1763, 129, two-twenty carried , for him , a cargo more 
Lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-03.png, 1806, 136, precious than jewels . Though Mofydd Owen 
Lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-04.png, 1830, 137, was , as he feared , departed out of his life , 
Lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-05.png, 1787, 136, he still loved her dearly . Already , even 
Lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-06.png, 1776, 154, as with trembling fingers he fastened his 
Lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-07.png, 1744, 154, trouser clips , he was seeing her lying in 
Lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-08.png, 1658, 139, some dreadful ravine , or beset by 
Lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-09.png, 1843, 130, robbers , or being whisked off to Emergency 
Lines/m04/m04-072/m04-072-10.png, 419, 87, Ward 10 . 
Lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-00.png, 1735, 127, But the jet aircraft was already miles away , 
Lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-01.png, 1613, 115, swinging down to the darkening earth . " It 
Lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-02.png, 1636, 100, passed me at fifty thousand feet , sir . It was 
Lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-03.png, 1846, 116, climbing steadily . " Group Captain Llewelyn Jones , Officer 
Lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-04.png, 1758, 113, Commanding R.A.F. Station , Dinas , looked keenly at the 
Lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-05.png, 1796, 106, Flying Officer who had burst so unceremoniously into his 
Lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-06.png, 1901, 127, office . " And what did it look like , Broughtons ? Some 
Lines/m04/m04-145/m04-145-07.png, 599, 89, sort of rocket ? " 
Lines/m04/m04-246/m04-246-00.png, 1766, 119, Mutinous dog , thought the Rev. Edwards , who hadn't 
Lines/m04/m04-246/m04-246-01.png, 1638, 126, enjoyed himself so much since reading Treasure 
Lines/m04/m04-246/m04-246-02.png, 1642, 120, Island . " What have you got in that basket , Price ? " 
Lines/m04/m04-246/m04-246-03.png, 1730, 116, he roared . Quelled , Mr. Price pulled out a grocery 
Lines/m04/m04-246/m04-246-04.png, 1529, 105, list , pushed his glasses up on his nose , and 
Lines/m04/m04-246/m04-246-05.png, 1636, 106, began to read . " Six loaves , four pounds butter , 
Lines/m04/m04-246/m04-246-06.png, 1789, 113, two pounds marge , one tin pineapple , one York ham . " 
Lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-00.png, 1850, 128, All lit up . Full of people waving as you went past . " 
Lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-01.png, 1827, 107, Suddenly he crouched forward . " Broughtons , if I thought 
Lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-02.png, 1713, 107, there were anything in Queen's Regulations to cover this , 
Lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-03.png, 1704, 121, I 'd have you court-martialled . But I know there 
Lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-04.png, 1626, 102, isn't , " he ended sadly . " I tried to read the 
Lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-05.png, 1811, 130, registration number , sir . But it was getting dark . " 
Lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-06.png, 1767, 107, He waited . But his commanding officer appeared to 
Lines/m04/m04-180/m04-180-07.png, 623, 96, have forgotten him . 
Lines/m04/m04-000/m04-000-00.png, 1678, 116, NO ONE has ever satisfactorily explained how a 
Lines/m04/m04-000/m04-000-01.png, 1691, 129, single-decker Welsh bus could have got 
Lines/m04/m04-000/m04-000-02.png, 1766, 130, itself into orbit . Shooting up over the pass a bit 
Lines/m04/m04-000/m04-000-03.png, 1590, 136, too carefree , and becoming airborne ? 
Lines/m04/m04-000/m04-000-04.png, 1651, 120, Caught by a sudden gust of wind ? A 
Lines/m04/m04-000/m04-000-05.png, 1746, 116, combination of the two ? No one seems 
Lines/m04/m04-000/m04-000-06.png, 1736, 128, to know . But the fact remains that get 
Lines/m04/m04-000/m04-000-07.png, 1002, 107, itself into orbit it did . 
Lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-00.png, 1666, 135, Flying Officer Broughtons shuffled his feet . 
Lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-01.png, 1774, 109, " Well , actually , sir , it looked like - like a bus . 
Lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-02.png, 1665, 114, A single-decker , " he elaborated . Daggers , the 
Lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-03.png, 1816, 109, Group Captain looked . " Broughtons , " he said silkily . 
Lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-04.png, 1783, 108, " Didn't they teach you at Cranwell that buses are 
Lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-05.png, 1709, 129, earth-bound creatures ? Aeroplanes fly , Broughtons . 
Lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-06.png, 1690, 111, Buses crawl . " Very pale , Broughtons was . But 
Lines/m04/m04-152/m04-152-07.png, 1042, 82, determined . " It was a bus , sir . 
Lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-00.png, 1606, 118, Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the 
Lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-01.png, 1537, 135, pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft 
Lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-02.png, 1563, 133, dipped slightly . The needle of the speed 
Lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-03.png, 1713, 130, recorder swung gently through 8.0 , 7.0 , 6.0 
Lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-04.png, 1737, 137, before coming to rest at 5.0 . " We 're a bit 
Lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-05.png, 1694, 125, ahead of time , " said Alastair . " We 'll run 
Lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-06.png, 1585, 128, in on minimum engine power . " Geoffrey 
Lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-07.png, 1696, 142, smiled . Alastair talked of running in when 
Lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-08.png, 1676, 128, they were still more than four hundred 
Lines/n01/n01-045/n01-045-09.png, 1217, 127, miles from their destination . 
Lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-00.png, 1698, 181, Geoffrey set himself to consider the 
Lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-01.png, 1830, 197, movements of the Bentley . It had passed 
Lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-02.png, 1688, 219, him at the temporary bridge over the 
Lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-03.png, 1750, 202, Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the 
Lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-04.png, 1933, 180, previous night . He worked out the distance 
Lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-05.png, 1979, 142, on the presumption that its route had been 
Lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-06.png, 1893, 177, through Florence and Rome and then 
Lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-07.png, 1785, 212, across Italy via Foggia to Barletta . 
Lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-08.png, 1715, 168, It came to just over six hundred 
Lines/n01/n01-057/n01-057-09.png, 315, 114, miles . 
Lines/n01/n01-000/n01-000-00.png, 1619, 96, Alastair was a bachelor . All his life he had 
Lines/n01/n01-000/n01-000-01.png, 1667, 167, been inclined to regard women as something 
Lines/n01/n01-000/n01-000-02.png, 1727, 117, which must necessarily be subordinated to his 
Lines/n01/n01-000/n01-000-03.png, 1824, 181, career . Now he realised that he was entrusting not only 
Lines/n01/n01-000/n01-000-04.png, 1770, 152, his own life , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl 
Lines/n01/n01-000/n01-000-05.png, 1817, 120, whom he had never met and on whom after no more 
Lines/n01/n01-000/n01-000-06.png, 1523, 135, than a couple of telephone calls he was 
Lines/n01/n01-000/n01-000-07.png, 1379, 124, prepared to place complete reliance . 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-00.png, 2141, 146, They were nearing Modena . Geoffrey focused the radar scanner 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-01.png, 1980, 195, on the bridge over the Po , barely forty miles to port . 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-02.png, 1857, 134, He was able to trace the course of the river ; he 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-03.png, 2075, 164, thought he could recognise the route of N12 , 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-04.png, 1878, 150, along which he had motored so desperately little 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-05.png, 2007, 145, more than twenty-four hours earlier . Since then 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-06.png, 1912, 195, he had flown to England , attended the vital 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-07.png, 2030, 143, conference in Bruce Denton's office , been whisked 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-08.png, 1891, 153, by special helicopter from the Horse Guards 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-09.png, 2081, 129, Parade to Boscombe Down , slept for six blessed 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-10.png, 2127, 142, refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-11.png, 1891, 134, of the journey back to the place where every 
Lines/n01/n01-052/n01-052-12.png, 1681, 163, indication pointed to Eve being held . 
Lines/n01/n01-020/n01-020-00.png, 1693, 123, For some reason the orderlies had forgotten 
Lines/n01/n01-020/n01-020-01.png, 1760, 173, to switch on the lights ; there was no colour - 
Lines/n01/n01-020/n01-020-02.png, 1848, 161, physical features were distinguishable solely by 
Lines/n01/n01-020/n01-020-03.png, 1892, 149, gradations of silvery greyness . Even the snow- 
Lines/n01/n01-020/n01-020-04.png, 1653, 133, capped summit of Mont Blanc , seven miles 
Lines/n01/n01-020/n01-020-05.png, 1849, 132, below , was not recognisable among the host 
Lines/n01/n01-020/n01-020-06.png, 1851, 174, of lower peaks . The screen of the air-to-air 
Lines/n01/n01-020/n01-020-07.png, 1694, 126, radar glowed . Occasionally minute spots 
Lines/n01/n01-020/n01-020-08.png, 1787, 128, flickered across its surface , but there was 
Lines/n01/n01-020/n01-020-09.png, 922, 139, no permanent image . 
Lines/n01/n01-004/n01-004-00.png, 1887, 122, It was a novel experience . Alastair was 
Lines/n01/n01-004/n01-004-01.png, 1923, 168, quite unable to explain why he should feel 
Lines/n01/n01-004/n01-004-02.png, 1884, 162, so much confidence in her . Once again 
Lines/n01/n01-004/n01-004-03.png, 1850, 120, she checked back her instructions . It was 
Lines/n01/n01-004/n01-004-04.png, 1916, 201, obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the 
Lines/n01/n01-004/n01-004-05.png, 1790, 220, faith which he was placing in her and 
Lines/n01/n01-004/n01-004-06.png, 1835, 132, was prepared to accept the responsibility . 
Lines/n01/n01-009/n01-009-00.png, 1785, 223, " Good luck , Air Marshal , " she said gently . " I 'll 
Lines/n01/n01-009/n01-009-01.png, 1763, 169, be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this 
Lines/n01/n01-009/n01-009-02.png, 1872, 194, evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you 
Lines/n01/n01-009/n01-009-03.png, 1678, 147, both at midnight . " They might have been 
Lines/n01/n01-009/n01-009-04.png, 1639, 163, arranging a supper party . Then she rang off . 
Lines/n01/n01-009/n01-009-05.png, 1825, 147, Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether 
Lines/n01/n01-009/n01-009-06.png, 1767, 144, uneventful life had he come across a girl who 
Lines/n01/n01-009/n01-009-07.png, 1694, 185, sounded so charming and appeared to be so 
Lines/n01/n01-009/n01-009-08.png, 281, 171, efficient . 
Lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-00.png, 1632, 130, In the exceptional clarity he was even able to 
Lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-01.png, 1684, 110, make a direct comparison between the radar 
Lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-02.png, 1629, 121, image and the ground itself . Ahead lay the 
Lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-03.png, 1726, 130, Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the 
Lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-04.png, 1593, 137, left , Milan . The directional angle of the 
Lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-05.png, 1530, 154, scanner could be adjusted to cover any 
Lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-06.png, 1758, 132, particular area within its range . Geoffrey 
Lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-07.png, 1612, 120, turned the scale slowly to cover the 
Lines/n01/n01-031/n01-031-08.png, 1062, 128, ground immediately ahead . 
Lines/n01/n01-036/n01-036-00.png, 1575, 103, He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the 
Lines/n01/n01-036/n01-036-01.png, 1611, 119, naked eye , obscured by the ground haze which even 
Lines/n01/n01-036/n01-036-02.png, 1717, 124, on the clearest night limited angular vision . He glanced 
Lines/n01/n01-036/n01-036-03.png, 1644, 88, at the speed recorder . It seemed almost incredible that 
Lines/n01/n01-036/n01-036-04.png, 1629, 106, the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle 
Lines/n01/n01-036/n01-036-05.png, 1414, 122, was resting could really mean hundreds of knots . 
Lines/h01/h01-014/h01-014-00.png, 1830, 123, Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions 
Lines/h01/h01-014/h01-014-01.png, 1827, 137, about housing and households . In 1961 the scope of the 
Lines/h01/h01-014/h01-014-02.png, 1742, 132, question was wider than before , because of the great 
Lines/h01/h01-014/h01-014-03.png, 1822, 133, use of the data to the Ministry of Housing and Local 
Lines/h01/h01-014/h01-014-04.png, 1897, 106, Government and to local authorities . As before , the record 
Lines/h01/h01-014/h01-014-05.png, 1866, 128, made during the enumeration lists all buildings , residen- 
Lines/h01/h01-014/h01-014-06.png, 1861, 130, tial premises and temporary places of abode , and all

Lines/h01/h01-000/h01-000-01.png, 1773, 124, again included , as they had been at the 
Lines/h01/h01-000/h01-000-02.png, 1941, 110, 1911 and 1951 Censuses . The former had asked 
Lines/h01/h01-000/h01-000-03.png, 2051, 132, for marriage details for all married women ,

Lines/h01/h01-000/h01-000-07.png, 2034, 111, married , and so repeated the enquiry made

Lines/h01/h01-007/h01-007-02.png, 1790, 117, the question , was the date of termination 
Lines/h01/h01-007/h01-007-03.png, 1827, 144, of the first or only marriage . This enables

Lines/h01/h01-024/h01-024-00.png, 1689, 107, A new question asked about housing tenure , whether 
Lines/h01/h01-024/h01-024-01.png, 1744, 97, the accommodation occupied by each household was held by 
Lines/h01/h01-024/h01-024-02.png, 1701, 92, them as owner-occupiers ; occupied in connection with

Lines/h01/h01-024/h01-024-06.png, 1839, 104, occupied on some other terms . The analysis of private

Lines/h01/h01-027/h01-027-07.png, 1651, 120, for a more accurate distribution of 
Lines/h01/h01-027/h01-027-08.png, 1828, 122, households by size as usually constituted 
Lines/h01/h01-027/h01-027-09.png, 1882, 128, had become more important by 1961 , and 
Lines/h01/h01-027/h01-027-10.png, 1992, 127, accordingly a new question was introduced , ... 
Lines/h01/h01-010/h01-010-00.png, 1786, 132, This is particularly important in estimating the trends 
Lines/h01/h01-010/h01-010-01.png, 1655, 116, in the size and pattern of families for successive 
Lines/h01/h01-010/h01-010-02.png, 1777, 132, generations over as long a period as possible , as the 
Lines/h01/h01-010/h01-010-03.png, 1784, 138, proportion of widows predominates in the higher age 
Lines/h01/h01-010/h01-010-04.png, 1746, 136, groups . In Wales and Monmouthshire the question 
Lines/h01/h01-010/h01-010-05.png, 1655, 134, on the ability to speak Welsh was included as 
Lines/h01/h01-010/h01-010-06.png, 1858, 132, previously . The question was first asked in 1891 , and 
Lines/h01/h01-010/h01-010-07.png, 1401, 128, was given its present form in 1931 . 
Lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-00.png, 1788, 117, This man was known to have left his home on February 11 , and 
Lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-01.png, 1799, 93, to have been away for four days . Not in itself a crime , but , added to 
Lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-02.png, 1833, 101, the knowledge that he had gone shopping in the town of Guil- 
Lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-03.png, 1711, 82, dford for a false moustache , it left him with something to 
Lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-04.png, 1786, 109, explain . His story was that he had left home to try to 
Lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-05.png, 1854, 104, join the Army ( presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance 
Lines/f04/f04-049/f04-049-06.png, 1293, 100, his military bearing ) , and this was accepted . 
Lines/f04/f04-068/f04-068-00.png, 1876, 103, For all that , as far as England is concerned , 
Lines/f04/f04-068/f04-068-01.png, 1708, 70, there have been only two occasions on 
Lines/f04/f04-068/f04-068-02.png, 1763, 78, which a body has been found in a tunnel 
Lines/f04/f04-068/f04-068-03.png, 1548, 75, in circumstances pointing to murder . 
Lines/f04/f04-068/f04-068-04.png, 1751, 105, The first was that of Mr Gold , in the famous 
Lines/f04/f04-068/f04-068-05.png, 1846, 96, Lefroy case , and by an odd chance the second tragedy 
Lines/f04/f04-068/f04-068-06.png, 1776, 91, occurred on the same line , although this time the 
Lines/f04/f04-068/f04-068-07.png, 725, 45, victim was a woman . 
Lines/f04/f04-071/f04-071-00.png, 1902, 104, Though in the minds of most people there was 
Lines/f04/f04-071/f04-071-01.png, 1724, 97, no doubt that the woman had been the victim 
Lines/f04/f04-071/f04-071-02.png, 1968, 89, of foul play , the verdict brought in was that there 
Lines/f04/f04-071/f04-071-03.png, 1872, 69, was not sufficient evidence to show whether 
Lines/f04/f04-071/f04-071-04.png, 1883, 71, she had fallen or been thrown from a train . 
Lines/f04/f04-071/f04-071-05.png, 1920, 99, The Merstham Tunnel , on the London-to- 
Lines/f04/f04-071/f04-071-06.png, 1933, 110, Brighton line , is approximately one mile long , 
Lines/f04/f04-071/f04-071-07.png, 1887, 86, and some time before midnight on September

Lines/f04/f04-057/f04-057-00.png, 1746, 150, The next female fatality occurred eight years later , 
Lines/f04/f04-057/f04-057-01.png, 1757, 130, yet so strange were the circumstances that it was 
Lines/f04/f04-057/f04-057-02.png, 1755, 141, a further seven years before even a ghost of a 
Lines/f04/f04-057/f04-057-03.png, 1760, 146, solution emerged . There has always been something 
Lines/f04/f04-057/f04-057-04.png, 1708, 130, sinister in the idea of tunnels . The building of 
Lines/f04/f04-057/f04-057-05.png, 1748, 138, them was one of the most dangerous jobs con- 
Lines/f04/f04-057/f04-057-06.png, 1593, 148, nected with railway construction ; and there 
Lines/f04/f04-057/f04-057-07.png, 1741, 140, were many people who believed that to travel 
Lines/f04/f04-057/f04-057-08.png, 1455, 144, through tunnels would be an equally 
Lines/f04/f04-057/f04-057-09.png, 696, 100, hazardous business . 
Lines/f04/f04-096/f04-096-00.png, 1570, 112, A guard reported that at East Croydon 
Lines/f04/f04-096/f04-096-01.png, 1637, 95, he had seen what was accepted as the 
Lines/f04/f04-096/f04-096-02.png, 1606, 127, same couple sitting close together in 
Lines/f04/f04-096/f04-096-03.png, 1478, 102, a first-class compartment of the 
Lines/f04/f04-096/f04-096-04.png, 1618, 124, train from London Bridge of which 
Lines/f04/f04-096/f04-096-05.png, 1568, 120, he was in charge . The two could 
Lines/f04/f04-096/f04-096-06.png, 1546, 117, have joined this train by taking 
Lines/f04/f04-096/f04-096-07.png, 1449, 173, one from Victoria and changing 
Lines/f04/f04-096/f04-096-08.png, 1620, 112, at East Croydon . He also believed 
Lines/f04/f04-096/f04-096-09.png, 1582, 142, that they had still been together at 
Lines/f04/f04-096/f04-096-10.png, 1652, 114, South Croydon , and he remembered 
Lines/f04/f04-053/f04-053-00.png, 1534, 147, And so the inquest , which had dragged on , with 
Lines/f04/f04-053/f04-053-01.png, 1770, 125, adjournments , until April 7 , finally had to be content to return 
Lines/f04/f04-053/f04-053-02.png, 1708, 120, a verdict of " wilful murder against some person or 
Lines/f04/f04-053/f04-053-03.png, 1776, 113, persons unknown . " The most vital clue of the Wedgwood 
Lines/f04/f04-053/f04-053-04.png, 1702, 110, pestle had been of no assistance . The killer must 
Lines/f04/f04-053/f04-053-05.png, 1584, 131, have been very thankful that the science of 
Lines/f04/f04-053/f04-053-06.png, 1493, 153, dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings . 
Lines/f04/f04-087/f04-087-00.png, 1719, 59, On the Sunday , the day of her death , she had gone out in the 
Lines/f04/f04-087/f04-087-01.png, 1736, 60, evening at about seven o'clock , telling her room-mate , Emma 
Lines/f04/f04-087/f04-087-02.png, 1747, 64, Hone , that she was going for a walk , but would not be 
Lines/f04/f04-087/f04-087-03.png, 1776, 68, gone for long . According to Miss Hone , she had not been 
Lines/f04/f04-087/f04-087-04.png, 1808, 70, carrying a handbag , but she believed she had had a small 
Lines/f04/f04-087/f04-087-05.png, 188, 41, purse . 
Lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-00.png, 1727, 126, The body was examined , and it was definitely 
Lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-01.png, 1850, 195, established that no sexual assault had taken place . 
Lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-02.png, 1653, 175, It seemed probable that the motive had been 
Lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-03.png, 1792, 176, robbery , and this was further confirmed when a 
Lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-04.png, 1712, 133, check was made with the woman's relations in 
Lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-05.png, 1824, 210, Hounslow . Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the 
Lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-06.png, 1798, 170, Good Intent , a public-house in Walworth . Her day 
Lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-07.png, 1858, 208, off was Thursday , and before coming up to London 
Lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-08.png, 1862, 190, in the evening she had called on her two sisters , 
Lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-09.png, 1762, 171, one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the 
Lines/f04/f04-011/f04-011-10.png, 1575, 216, other at Hounslow , where she kept a shop . 
Lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-00.png, 1822, 72, They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours , so- 
Lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-01.png, 1810, 70, me well meant , some mischievous , including one that a 
Lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-02.png, 1826, 77, man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on 
Lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-03.png, 1792, 84, the Thursday evening , with blood actually dripping from 
Lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-04.png, 1854, 69, his hands . The inquest was opened on February 17 , but , 
Lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-05.png, 1821, 82, beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of 
Lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-06.png, 1830, 63, the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage 
Lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-07.png, 1764, 75, in which she had died , there was nothing on 
Lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-08.png, 1614, 101, which to proceed , and the inquest was 
Lines/f04/f04-032/f04-032-09.png, 481, 71, adjourned . 
Lines/f04/f04-074/f04-074-00.png, 1728, 77, It was the battered and broken body of a woman . 
Lines/f04/f04-074/f04-074-01.png, 1831, 136, He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham 
Lines/f04/f04-074/f04-074-02.png, 1848, 139, Station , and a stretcher party took the body to 
Lines/f04/f04-074/f04-074-03.png, 1803, 109, the Feathers Hotel to await identification . 
Lines/f04/f04-074/f04-074-04.png, 1868, 148, Was it a case of suicide , where some unhappy soul 
Lines/f04/f04-074/f04-074-05.png, 1882, 142, had walked deliberately into the blackness and 
Lines/f04/f04-074/f04-074-06.png, 1855, 193, into the path of some train ? This hardly seemed 
Lines/f04/f04-074/f04-074-07.png, 1890, 166, likely , since , when she was examined by a local 
Lines/f04/f04-074/f04-074-08.png, 2015, 188, doctor , the woman , young , small , and rather plump , 
Lines/f04/f04-074/f04-074-09.png, 1792, 135, was found to have her own silk scarf drawn 
Lines/f04/f04-074/f04-074-10.png, 2022, 202, almost tight enough to strangle her , and the ends 
Lines/f04/f04-074/f04-074-11.png, 1711, 123, thrust in her mouth like a gag . 
Lines/f04/f04-024/f04-024-00.png, 1840, 129, The police began a systematic search of the line - 
Lines/f04/f04-024/f04-024-01.png, 1763, 121, no easy task , but one in which patience and method 
Lines/f04/f04-024/f04-024-02.png, 1691, 130, paid off . At a spot on the embankment between 
Lines/f04/f04-024/f04-024-03.png, 1814, 111, Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained 
Lines/f04/f04-024/f04-024-04.png, 1725, 111, pestle such as chemists use , with some hairs 
Lines/f04/f04-024/f04-024-05.png, 1815, 134, sticking to it . The murder weapon , more than likely , 
Lines/f04/f04-024/f04-024-06.png, 1761, 156, and perhaps evidence enough to have brought a 
Lines/f04/f04-024/f04-024-07.png, 989, 89, killer to book in modern times . 
Lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-00.png, 1906, 89, She had been struck several times with a blunt 
Lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-01.png, 1775, 115, instrument , and her head was smashed in . 
Lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-02.png, 1836, 148, There were signs of a violent struggle , blood 
Lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-03.png, 1927, 149, on the cushions and floor , and the remains 
Lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-04.png, 1819, 140, of her broken umbrella . But a pair of bone 
Lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-05.png, 1830, 149, cuff-links found in the compartment seemed 
Lines/f04/f04-007/f04-007-06.png, 1968, 155, to provide the only possible clue to the killer . 
Lines/f04/f04-046/f04-046-00.png, 1704, 115, Even the bone cuff-links found beside the body , which 
Lines/f04/f04-046/f04-046-01.png, 1696, 97, had at first been considered as belonging to the killer , 
Lines/f04/f04-046/f04-046-02.png, 1796, 103, proved yet another red herring , for it was learned that 
Lines/f04/f04-046/f04-046-03.png, 1695, 99, they had been borrowed by Elizabeth Camp from one 
Lines/f04/f04-046/f04-046-04.png, 1790, 99, of her sisters . A young man from Reading named Marshall 
Lines/f04/f04-046/f04-046-05.png, 1853, 106, had an uncomfortable time in the presence of the coroner . 
Lines/f04/f04-061/f04-061-00.png, 1764, 93, Some thought that the result would be all 
Lines/f04/f04-061/f04-061-01.png, 1774, 90, sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the 
Lines/f04/f04-061/f04-061-02.png, 1806, 87, confined atmosphere . " The shareholders who travel 
Lines/f04/f04-061/f04-061-03.png, 1743, 89, by it will be so heartily sick , what with the 
Lines/f04/f04-061/f04-061-04.png, 1835, 96, foul air , smoke and sulphur , that the mention 
Lines/f04/f04-061/f04-061-05.png, 1819, 96, of a railway will be worse than Ipecacuanha , " 
Lines/f04/f04-061/f04-061-06.png, 1799, 109, wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was 
Lines/f04/f04-061/f04-061-07.png, 1341, 94, proposed to build the Box Tunnel . 
Lines/f04/f04-079/f04-079-00.png, 1825, 107, Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising , 
Lines/f04/f04-079/f04-079-01.png, 1732, 129, and there were other injuries on her body which had 
Lines/f04/f04-079/f04-079-02.png, 1708, 114, occurred before her death was ensured by some 
Lines/f04/f04-079/f04-079-03.png, 1866, 143, train which had roared through the tunnel . There were 
Lines/f04/f04-079/f04-079-04.png, 1868, 127, no letters or papers found on her to assist identi 
Lines/f04/f04-079/f04-079-05.png, 1822, 145, fication , no money , and no railway ticket . By then 
Lines/f04/f04-079/f04-079-06.png, 1915, 160, reports were being gathered about all traffic over 
Lines/f04/f04-079/f04-079-07.png, 1818, 139, this stretch of line , but no information was 
Lines/f04/f04-079/f04-079-08.png, 1865, 168, forthcoming about any carriage with an open 
Lines/f04/f04-079/f04-079-09.png, 1921, 159, door , nor any passenger reporting an incident 
Lines/f04/f04-079/f04-079-10.png, 829, 166, which might relate . 
Lines/f04/f04-100/f04-100-00.png, 1632, 106, Medical evidence established that Mary 
Lines/f04/f04-100/f04-100-01.png, 1574, 97, Money had been dead for about an 
Lines/f04/f04-100/f04-100-02.png, 1656, 113, hour before her body was discovered , 
Lines/f04/f04-100/f04-100-03.png, 1750, 128, and this matched reasonably well with 
Lines/f04/f04-100/f04-100-04.png, 1654, 116, the timetable of the train in question . 
Lines/f04/f04-100/f04-100-05.png, 1656, 105, More important evidence came from a 
Lines/f04/f04-100/f04-100-06.png, 1705, 125, signalman at Purley Oaks , who had 
Lines/f04/f04-100/f04-100-07.png, 1686, 118, seen , as the train passed his box , a 
Lines/f04/f04-100/f04-100-08.png, 1489, 118, couple struggling in a first-class 
Lines/f04/f04-100/f04-100-09.png, 1601, 96, compartment ; but he seemed to have 
Lines/f04/f04-100/f04-100-10.png, 1679, 119, been used to seeing couples engaged in 
Lines/f04/f04-035/f04-035-00.png, 1864, 99, Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely 
Lines/f04/f04-035/f04-035-01.png, 1840, 74, trails . It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending 
Lines/f04/f04-035/f04-035-02.png, 1856, 78, money to her relatives , and her brother-in-law was asked for 
Lines/f04/f04-035/f04-035-03.png, 1854, 70, a detailed account of his movements on the 11th . The dead 
Lines/f04/f04-035/f04-035-04.png, 1818, 74, woman had been engaged once before - to a barman 
Lines/f04/f04-035/f04-035-05.png, 513, 54, named Brown . 
Lines/f04/f04-043/f04-043-00.png, 1630, 102, The porter at the station bore out this 
Lines/f04/f04-043/f04-043-01.png, 1763, 84, description , but the man was not traced . 
Lines/f04/f04-043/f04-043-02.png, 1843, 124, Perhaps the news of their search got around , 
Lines/f04/f04-043/f04-043-03.png, 1820, 106, for a man did obligingly present himself 
Lines/f04/f04-043/f04-043-04.png, 1901, 129, at Wandsworth police-station , claiming to have 
Lines/f04/f04-043/f04-043-05.png, 1821, 108, committed the murder - but he was mentally 
Lines/f04/f04-043/f04-043-06.png, 1796, 139, defective , and , despite his claim to infamy , 
Lines/f04/f04-043/f04-043-07.png, 1922, 125, had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening . 
Lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-00.png, 1743, 105, This man agreed that his engagement had 
Lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-01.png, 1741, 121, been broken off after one particular 
Lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-02.png, 1802, 108, tiff , but denied that he owed Miss Camp any 
Lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-03.png, 1853, 87, money . All the while the police were casting about 
Lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-04.png, 1838, 98, for a man who had been seen leaving the train 
Lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-05.png, 1859, 88, at Wandsworth . A passenger described this individual 
Lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-06.png, 1883, 101, as a man of about thirty , of medium height , with 
Lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-07.png, 1685, 94, a dark moustache , and wearing a frockcoat 
Lines/f04/f04-039/f04-039-08.png, 612, 79, and a top-hat . 
Lines/f04/f04-004/f04-004-00.png, 1651, 144, When he learned what was causing the commotion he 
Lines/f04/f04-004/f04-004-01.png, 1797, 156, became greatly alarmed , and after the body had been 
Lines/f04/f04-004/f04-004-02.png, 1638, 175, taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his 
Lines/f04/f04-004/f04-004-03.png, 1722, 208, grief-stricken duty formally to identify Elizabeth 
Lines/f04/f04-004/f04-004-04.png, 1815, 179, Camp , aged thirty-three , the girl who was to have 
Lines/f04/f04-004/f04-004-05.png, 1756, 180, been his bride . There was little doubt of how 
Lines/f04/f04-004/f04-004-06.png, 1779, 206, she had met her death , and even less that it 
Lines/f04/f04-004/f04-004-07.png, 674, 128, had been murder . 
Lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-00.png, 1839, 169, Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon , 
Lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-01.png, 1850, 158, and arrived at Hounslow around 5 P.M. , where 
Lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-02.png, 1813, 158, she had tea with her other sister , and then 
Lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-03.png, 1796, 141, went to catch the 7.42 . Her sister saw her 
Lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-04.png, 1798, 194, to the station , helping her with some of 
Lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-05.png, 1839, 205, her packages . This sister was able to establish 
Lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-06.png, 1786, 194, that she had carried a green purse and 
Lines/f04/f04-016/f04-016-07.png, 1315, 185, had bought a railway ticket . 
Lines/f04/f04-064/f04-064-00.png, 1760, 113, The mere thought of subterranean travel 
Lines/f04/f04-064/f04-064-01.png, 1788, 109, gave others a feeling of danger . A medical journal 
Lines/f04/f04-064/f04-064-02.png, 1807, 105, said , " the deafening peal of thunder , the sudden 
Lines/f04/f04-064/f04-064-03.png, 1827, 83, immersion in gloom , and the clash of reverberated 
Lines/f04/f04-064/f04-064-04.png, 1759, 87, sounds in a confined space combine to produce a 
Lines/f04/f04-064/f04-064-05.png, 1887, 90, momentary shudder , or idea of destruction , a thrill 
Lines/f04/f04-064/f04-064-06.png, 1720, 87, of annihilation . " It was also prophesied that 
Lines/f04/f04-064/f04-064-07.png, 1746, 113, passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the 
Lines/f04/f04-064/f04-064-08.png, 323, 85, darkness . 
Lines/f04/f04-093/f04-093-00.png, 1563, 100, At Clapham Junction a ticket-collector 
Lines/f04/f04-093/f04-093-01.png, 1725, 120, was able to identify a photograph of the 
Lines/f04/f04-093/f04-093-02.png, 1709, 128, girl , and he said he had last seen her 
Lines/f04/f04-093/f04-093-03.png, 1555, 118, on platform six waiting to board 
Lines/f04/f04-093/f04-093-04.png, 1687, 90, a train for the short run to Victoria . 
Lines/f04/f04-093/f04-093-05.png, 1762, 126, A passenger at Victoria said he had seen 
Lines/f04/f04-093/f04-093-06.png, 1571, 111, a young lady " as near as possible " 
Lines/f04/f04-093/f04-093-07.png, 1667, 129, like the photograph shown him , with 
Lines/f04/f04-093/f04-093-08.png, 1686, 110, a man " very close in conversation and 
Lines/f04/f04-093/f04-093-09.png, 1006, 127, walking arm in arm . " 
Lines/f04/f04-083/f04-083-00.png, 1780, 76, So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and 
Lines/f04/f04-083/f04-083-01.png, 1787, 74, long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head 
Lines/f04/f04-083/f04-083-02.png, 1746, 77, remained a mystery until later the following day . 
Lines/f04/f04-083/f04-083-03.png, 1726, 67, During that time a description of the girl was 
Lines/f04/f04-083/f04-083-04.png, 1667, 68, circulated , and a Mr Robert Money came forward to 
Lines/f04/f04-083/f04-083-05.png, 1867, 72, identify her as his sister , Mary Money , aged twenty-two . 
Lines/f04/f04-083/f04-083-06.png, 1834, 72, The girl , who was described as being " always bright and 
Lines/f04/f04-083/f04-083-07.png, 1724, 84, jolly , " had been unmarried , and lived at Lavender Hill , 
Lines/f04/f04-083/f04-083-08.png, 1709, 85, Clapham , on the premises of a dairyman , Bridger , for 
Lines/f04/f04-083/f04-083-09.png, 1243, 59, whom she worked as a book-keeper . 
Lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-00.png, 1924, 171, But in 1897 , alas ! there was no fingerprint bureau , 
Lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-01.png, 1834, 153, no experts to check and photograph any ' dabs ' it 
Lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-02.png, 1797, 186, might have yielded . It was a tough case to 
Lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-03.png, 1940, 143, tackle , and Superintendent Robinson , of the L.S.W.R. 
Lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-04.png, 1852, 138, Police , and Chief Inspector Marshall , of Scotland 
Lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-05.png, 1806, 183, Yard , combined forces in the investigation . While 
Lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-06.png, 1907, 154, accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp had been 
Lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-07.png, 1815, 156, attacked for the sake of robbery , they did not 
Lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-08.png, 1675, 211, overlook the possibility that this might have 
Lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-09.png, 1856, 201, disguised another motive , and a thorough check 
Lines/f04/f04-028/f04-028-10.png, 1936, 143, of her former men friends and acquaintances began . 
Lines/f04/f04-020/f04-020-00.png, 1815, 134, But both purse and ticket , and the packages , were gone when the body 
Lines/f04/f04-020/f04-020-01.png, 1730, 135, was found at Waterloo . Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it 
Lines/f04/f04-020/f04-020-02.png, 1817, 143, likely that she had been carrying much money . A porter at Hounslow 
Lines/f04/f04-020/f04-020-03.png, 1856, 130, supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her 
Lines/f04/f04-020/f04-020-04.png, 1834, 135, compartment when the train left , but this did not help much , since it 
Lines/f04/f04-020/f04-020-05.png, 1291, 138, had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo . 
Lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-00.png, 1748, 105, Her figure was small and exquisite , like a schoolgirl's still , and 
Lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-01.png, 1663, 102, he admired her legs , which the male sex were inclined to 
Lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-02.png, 1637, 111, regard first . " I would mind if you didn't " he told her 
Lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-03.png, 1635, 123, grimly , and tugged her fiercely into his arms . " You 're 
Lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-04.png, 1665, 109, right , pet . I do need this leave . I 'm bad-tempered and 
Lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-05.png, 1740, 116, broody and going out with brash blondes . I don't deserve 
Lines/p03/p03-135/p03-135-06.png, 190, 134, you . " 
Lines/p03/p03-151/p03-151-00.png, 1685, 117, " Isn't it ? " he rose and smoothed himself 
Lines/p03/p03-151/p03-151-01.png, 1760, 135, down . " Ask any bridegroom-to-be . Anyhow , 
Lines/p03/p03-151/p03-151-02.png, 1673, 152, that particular problem isn't looming at 
Lines/p03/p03-151/p03-151-03.png, 1650, 126, the moment , thank God ! " Problem ... ? 
Lines/p03/p03-151/p03-151-04.png, 1780, 157, looming ... ? " Are we discussing a marriage 
Lines/p03/p03-151/p03-151-05.png, 1728, 154, or a burial ? " she asked , hardly believing 
Lines/p03/p03-151/p03-151-06.png, 1688, 147, he could be serious . " Surely marrying 
Lines/p03/p03-151/p03-151-07.png, 1630, 145, me isn't going to be all that bad ? 
Lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-00.png, 1846, 138, " No , " she told Phil Gubbins , a junior 
Lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-01.png, 1798, 127, houseman , " it wasn't Nigel you saw , 
Lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-02.png, 1718, 141, my lad . " " It was Nigel's car , anyway .

Lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-06.png, 1802, 140, face , Di , but it certainly looked like 
Lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-07.png, 1854, 145, Nigel from the back . D.j. and all . 
Lines/p03/p03-047/p03-047-08.png, 1871, 134, Of course such as I couldn't afford

Lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-00.png, 1790, 112, But after that slight slip of the tongue on Nigel's part she had 
Lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-01.png, 1785, 100, realised it was important enough for her to have remembered , and it 
Lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-02.png, 1760, 98, was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and 
Lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-03.png, 1778, 86, made her think there was an abyss immediately ahead . 
Lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-04.png, 1803, 110, " Nigel , " she had besought him , " you know that evening 
Lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-05.png, 1769, 105, you took Luke Parson's surgery and there was a woman 
Lines/p03/p03-069/p03-069-06.png, 1030, 93, with a cyst on her ear ... ? " 
Lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-00.png, 1598, 112, " Neither can Nigel , " smiled Diana . 
Lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-01.png, 1791, 136, " He 's saving up to get married . Remember ? " 
Lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-02.png, 1638, 120, " I remember , " quipped the houseman , 
Lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-03.png, 1631, 148, meaning no offence , " but does he ? 
Lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-04.png, 1757, 132, That blonde was something . " " Anybody

Lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-06.png, 1749, 124, I got a good look at her . But if Nigel 
Lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-07.png, 1695, 119, wasn't there it isn't important , is it ? " 
Lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-08.png, 1652, 119, " No , " Di said immediately . " It isn't at 
Lines/p03/p03-057/p03-057-09.png, 575, 105, all important . " 
Lines/p03/p03-173/p03-173-00.png, 1802, 92, Almost in desperation she appealed , " Will you meet 
Lines/p03/p03-173/p03-173-01.png, 1851, 119, me at the gate , four o'clock tomorrow ? " " Why ? " he 
Lines/p03/p03-173/p03-173-02.png, 1892, 130, enquired , combing his thick , tawny hair . " To bring 
Lines/p03/p03-173/p03-173-03.png, 1874, 124, me up for tea , of course . I just thought . " " I 'll see , " 
Lines/p03/p03-173/p03-173-04.png, 1983, 91, he told her , and suddenly seized her in an embrace 
Lines/p03/p03-173/p03-173-05.png, 1913, 111, which really hurt . " Without your ring it 's just like 
Lines/p03/p03-173/p03-173-06.png, 1985, 110, kissing somebody else's girl , " he decided wickedly , 
Lines/p03/p03-173/p03-173-07.png, 1789, 86, and kissed her again , somewhat startled to 
Lines/p03/p03-173/p03-173-08.png, 1420, 98, receive a sharp slap for his pains . 
Lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-00.png, 1766, 150, " Darling ! " her voiced caressed him . " Moments like this 
Lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-01.png, 1629, 131, make all the waiting worth while . When we 're 
Lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-02.png, 1801, 158, married we won't have these explosions of emotion , 
Lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-03.png, 1788, 126, will we ? " " No , " he eyed her strangely . " I wish we 
Lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-04.png, 1818, 140, were married , Di . Like a patient wishes his operation 
Lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-05.png, 1654, 160, was over . " Again her laughter trilled . " Marriage 
Lines/p03/p03-142/p03-142-06.png, 1415, 157, isn't as bad as an operation , Nigel ! " 
Lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-00.png, 1715, 153, " My white or my black ? " Nigel enquired . 
Lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-01.png, 1590, 85, " Now I wonder which I wore at that 
Lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-02.png, 1628, 143, particular surgery ? " " You are a fool , 
Lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-03.png, 1701, 139, darling , " Di said happily . " I shall take 
Lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-04.png, 1706, 131, great pleasure in telling that young man 
Lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-05.png, 1475, 121, exactly what you were doing that 
Lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-06.png, 1655, 157, evening . " " No , don't , " he said , after 
Lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-07.png, 1735, 131, kissing her again . " I rather like to have 
Lines/p03/p03-096/p03-096-08.png, 1419, 88, the housemen think of me as a

Lines/p03/p03-023/p03-023-01.png, 1802, 104, Sometimes they talked on the theme of " when we get married " , 
Lines/p03/p03-023/p03-023-02.png, 1765, 85, and then all was wonderful , and perhaps it had only been 
Lines/p03/p03-023/p03-023-03.png, 1640, 89, a slip of the tongue when Nigel had said , only last 
Lines/p03/p03-023/p03-023-04.png, 1733, 91, evening , " If we get married , old girl , you 'll have to stop 
Lines/p03/p03-023/p03-023-05.png, 910, 109, that lark , I can tell you ! " 
Lines/p03/p03-033/p03-033-00.png, 1898, 106, " Bless you ! I hope Luke is suitably grateful , darling . " " Oh , well , " 
Lines/p03/p03-033/p03-033-01.png, 1805, 56, he shrugged diffidently , " I like the work . One gets plenty 
Lines/p03/p03-033/p03-033-02.png, 1726, 57, of variety and it 's a change . " Nigel was the hospital's 
Lines/p03/p03-033/p03-033-03.png, 1878, 99, Junior Medical Officer . " You won't be free about nine , I 
Lines/p03/p03-033/p03-033-04.png, 1819, 72, suppose , to meet me for supper somewhere ? " she had 
Lines/p03/p03-033/p03-033-05.png, 502, 57, asked hopefully . 
Lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-00.png, 1671, 103, Thus had they parted the previous evening and now 
Lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-01.png, 1677, 97, Diana was trailing up the gravelled drive to the hospital 
Lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-02.png, 1711, 76, alone . Of course one couldn't say for certain when a 
Lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-03.png, 1799, 105, doctor would be free during the day ; tea was served 
Lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-04.png, 1745, 85, from four until five-thirty in the residents' common- 
Lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-05.png, 1764, 88, room , which proved the elasticity of medical commitments . 
Lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-06.png, 1775, 128, Something had cropped up which required Nigel's attention , 
Lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-07.png, 1796, 119, she was convinced , or he would have granted her small request 
Lines/p03/p03-185/p03-185-08.png, 696, 113, to be met at the gates . 
Lines/p03/p03-080/p03-080-00.png, 1932, 92, " Gubbins ? Gubbins ? " he fretted . " Who 's he ? " 
Lines/p03/p03-080/p03-080-01.png, 1860, 92, Though Diana knew the name of every 
Lines/p03/p03-080/p03-080-02.png, 1894, 74, member of the staff , distinguished or not , 
Lines/p03/p03-080/p03-080-03.png, 1944, 76, Nigel often had to think hard to sort 
Lines/p03/p03-080/p03-080-04.png, 2099, 86, them out . " He 's the carrotty lad , isn't he ? " 
Lines/p03/p03-080/p03-080-05.png, 1800, 60, he now demanded . " What was he 
Lines/p03/p03-080/p03-080-06.png, 1846, 95, doing at the Load of Trouble ? " 
Lines/p03/p03-121/p03-121-00.png, 1785, 142, I 'm going with a shooting party . What else can I do 
Lines/p03/p03-121/p03-121-01.png, 1738, 127, at this time of year ? I can't ask you up because it 's 
Lines/p03/p03-121/p03-121-02.png, 1881, 125, a strictly stag affair . " " I know . I didn't expect ... " " Well , 
Lines/p03/p03-121/p03-121-03.png, 1796, 135, don't keep hinting , then . You wish you could 
Lines/p03/p03-121/p03-121-04.png, 1869, 148, come with me ; you hope I 'll miss you ; you 
Lines/p03/p03-121/p03-121-05.png, 1681, 123, can't imagine the hospital without me for 
Lines/p03/p03-121/p03-121-06.png, 1360, 131, three weeks , etcetera , etcetera ! " 
Lines/p03/p03-009/p03-009-00.png, 1727, 116, " If I were a tramp I would simply blow a 
Lines/p03/p03-009/p03-009-01.png, 1814, 120, feather , " she decided , rather envying the gentle- 
Lines/p03/p03-009/p03-009-02.png, 1791, 81, man of the road his freedom of decision , and 
Lines/p03/p03-009/p03-009-03.png, 1886, 91, wishing life would sometimes allow serious-minded 
Lines/p03/p03-009/p03-009-04.png, 1889, 74, women doctors to blow a feather and follow its 
Lines/p03/p03-009/p03-009-05.png, 1855, 102, airy directions accordingly . " If I were needing a 
Lines/p03/p03-009/p03-009-06.png, 1903, 116, job I 'd go to London , of course , " she went on . 
Lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-00.png, 1565, 112, " Oh , he wasn't . His motor-bike had 
Lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-01.png, 1613, 76, broken down outside and he noticed 
Lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-02.png, 1726, 131, your car and then you dancing with 
Lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-03.png, 1620, 138, this blonde . " " Really ? " Nigel cocked 
Lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-04.png, 1735, 123, one eyebrow . " Actually she was brunette 
Lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-05.png, 1661, 77, at the roots and I had a redhead on 
Lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-06.png, 1579, 74, the other arm . He would have told 
Lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-07.png, 1524, 152, you this , too ? " " No , " she laughed . 
Lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-08.png, 1700, 135, " He didn't actually see you . Because 
Lines/p03/p03-087/p03-087-09.png, 1373, 112, it was your car I suppose he

Lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-00.png, 1649, 156, Now Nigel had every right to go where he 
Lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-01.png, 1962, 166, liked during his off-duty periods 
Lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-02.png, 1822, 146, when she was not free ; this much they had 
Lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-03.png, 1743, 152, conceded one to the other . They rarely 
Lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-04.png, 1741, 167, found they were off duty together , and 
Lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-05.png, 1865, 98, the situation would have been intolerable 
Lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-06.png, 1618, 161, had there not been some give and take 
Lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-07.png, 1777, 161, about their relationship . So when Nigel 
Lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-08.png, 1522, 169, had told her about taking Luke's 
Lines/p03/p03-029/p03-029-09.png, 1505, 175, evening surgery she had said , 
Lines/p03/p03-027/p03-027-00.png, 1745, 153, She couldn't remember what they had been talking about or

Lines/p03/p03-027/p03-027-02.png, 1734, 162, word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning , and 
Lines/p03/p03-027/p03-027-03.png, 1810, 175, with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information , 
Lines/p03/p03-027/p03-027-04.png, 1844, 168, which now took on an ominous significance : Nigel had been 
Lines/p03/p03-027/p03-027-05.png, 1836, 167, seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had 
Lines/p03/p03-027/p03-027-06.png, 1654, 176, been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in

Lines/p06/p06-104/p06-104-05.png, 1821, 337, him suddenly , making him say : 
Lines/p06/p06-104/p06-104-06.png, 1722, 204, ' You can't forgive him for this - 
Lines/p06/p06-104/p06-104-07.png, 1825, 180, can you ? ' ' Forgive is an unctuous , 
Lines/p06/p06-104/p06-104-08.png, 1972, 187, patronizing word , ' she replied . ' I despise 
Lines/p06/p06-104/p06-104-09.png, 1044, 125, the deceit . The lies . ' 
Lines/p06/p06-052/p06-052-00.png, 1727, 242, ' Good-bye , Sandra , ' he said 
Lines/p06/p06-052/p06-052-01.png, 1904, 190, with a deadly finality . Watching 
Lines/p06/p06-052/p06-052-02.png, 1826, 201, him go , unable to speak , she 
Lines/p06/p06-052/p06-052-03.png, 1839, 219, felt that part of her was leaving 
Lines/p06/p06-052/p06-052-04.png, 1814, 132, him . She couldn't hate him ... 
Lines/p06/p06-052/p06-052-05.png, 1840, 195, If only he would have con- 
Lines/p06/p06-052/p06-052-06.png, 1890, 179, fided in her , given some expla- 
Lines/p06/p06-052/p06-052-07.png, 1774, 116, nation . Now there was no- 
Lines/p06/p06-052/p06-052-08.png, 1844, 218, thing - not even friendship . 
Lines/p06/p06-088/p06-088-00.png, 1846, 201, Her eyes darkened in torment . ' Are 
Lines/p06/p06-088/p06-088-01.png, 1935, 202, you sure that she was telling the truth ? ' 
Lines/p06/p06-088/p06-088-02.png, 1878, 172, ' Good heavens , darling , why on earth 
Lines/p06/p06-088/p06-088-03.png, 2003, 166, should she lie ? Besides , it wasn't just 
Lines/p06/p06-088/p06-088-04.png, 1979, 171, her word . There was enough evidence , 
Lines/p06/p06-088/p06-088-05.png, 1771, 159, no matter how one might want to 
Lines/p06/p06-088/p06-088-06.png, 1624, 145, disbelieve the facts . ' Elation 
Lines/p06/p06-088/p06-088-07.png, 1789, 173, touched him after the cold wind 
Lines/p06/p06-088/p06-088-08.png, 1809, 201, of suspense . ' It will be interesting 
Lines/p06/p06-088/p06-088-09.png, 1831, 189, to see what comes out at the inquest . 
Lines/p06/p06-030/p06-030-00.png, 1970, 196, His mouth hardened , his eyes became 
Lines/p06/p06-030/p06-030-01.png, 1669, 192, steely . ' I see . ' Scorn lashed his 
Lines/p06/p06-030/p06-030-02.png, 1918, 184, words . ' I wonder you dared trust 
Lines/p06/p06-030/p06-030-03.png, 1740, 199, him to my care . ' ' Nicholas - ' 
Lines/p06/p06-030/p06-030-04.png, 1845, 133, ' Well ! At least I know the truth . 
Lines/p06/p06-030/p06-030-05.png, 1572, 202, Truth ! ' His gaze held hers 
Lines/p06/p06-030/p06-030-06.png, 1792, 176, masterfully . ' You wanted it so 
Lines/p06/p06-030/p06-030-07.png, 1873, 265, badly - at any price . I hope 
Lines/p06/p06-030/p06-030-08.png, 1194, 223, you are satisfied . ' 
Lines/p06/p06-242/p06-242-00.png, 1405, 113, Philip bristled . ' It was never our intention 
Lines/p06/p06-242/p06-242-01.png, 1485, 119, to have one of those carnival affairs , ' he 
Lines/p06/p06-242/p06-242-02.png, 1749, 116, retorted and in that second , he became the man of 
Lines/p06/p06-242/p06-242-03.png, 1748, 109, success exerting authority . Sandra watched her father's 
Lines/p06/p06-242/p06-242-04.png, 1570, 132, face pale . Philip , she knew , got on his nerves , but 
Lines/p06/p06-242/p06-242-05.png, 1688, 119, everything had gone over her head . It didn't really 
Lines/p06/p06-242/p06-242-06.png, 1594, 114, matter what was being said because she was 
Lines/p06/p06-242/p06-242-07.png, 746, 121, no longer a part of it . 
Lines/p06/p06-248/p06-248-00.png, 1658, 142, The thought of Nicholas haunted her , the sense of 
Lines/p06/p06-248/p06-248-01.png, 1742, 136, loss crucifying . Her father's comment roused her as 
Lines/p06/p06-248/p06-248-02.png, 1608, 124, he said , ' I was not talking of a carnival . But I 
Lines/p06/p06-248/p06-248-03.png, 1751, 109, presume we shall be allowed to have one or two 
Lines/p06/p06-248/p06-248-04.png, 1149, 120, of our friends at the ceremony . ' 
Lines/p06/p06-069/p06-069-00.png, 1887, 138, She had her truth . How much had built 
Lines/p06/p06-069/p06-069-01.png, 1853, 174, up from that first ideal , and how 
Lines/p06/p06-069/p06-069-02.png, 1757, 193, little joy , or satisfaction , it had 
Lines/p06/p06-069/p06-069-03.png, 1831, 190, given her . ' I 'm sorry , darling . ' 
Lines/p06/p06-069/p06-069-04.png, 1677, 192, He looked nervous . It had been 
Lines/p06/p06-069/p06-069-05.png, 1855, 197, hell lying there , knowing she was 
Lines/p06/p06-069/p06-069-06.png, 1946, 200, talking to Nicholas and wondering 
Lines/p06/p06-069/p06-069-07.png, 1790, 242, what they were saying . Sandra 
Lines/p06/p06-069/p06-069-08.png, 1761, 165, said instinctively : ' I told him 
Lines/p06/p06-069/p06-069-09.png, 1806, 166, I knew he was responsible for 
Lines/p06/p06-069/p06-069-10.png, 912, 180, Beryl's death . ' 
Lines/p06/p06-042/p06-042-00.png, 1729, 228, And as he spoke , the thought 
Lines/p06/p06-042/p06-042-01.png, 1670, 194, of Philip lying in the other 
Lines/p06/p06-042/p06-042-02.png, 1751, 226, room filled him with a re- 
Lines/p06/p06-042/p06-042-03.png, 1917, 176, vulsion that was homicidal . 
Lines/p06/p06-042/p06-042-04.png, 1934, 169, Even in that , his hands were 
Lines/p06/p06-042/p06-042-05.png, 1861, 191, tied . He dare not precipitate 
Lines/p06/p06-042/p06-042-06.png, 1824, 205, what might well be another 
Lines/p06/p06-042/p06-042-07.png, 2003, 304, coronary . And in that second 
Lines/p06/p06-042/p06-042-08.png, 1910, 195, he put back his professional 
Lines/p06/p06-042/p06-042-09.png, 1928, 145, mantle , and said with such 
Lines/p06/p06-042/p06-042-10.png, 1988, 213, icy politeness , such withdrawn 
Lines/p06/p06-058/p06-058-00.png, 1735, 179, She went back to Philip . But 
Lines/p06/p06-058/p06-058-01.png, 2034, 141, all she could hear were Nicholas's 
Lines/p06/p06-058/p06-058-02.png, 1730, 182, words : ' I love you - oh , you 
Lines/p06/p06-058/p06-058-03.png, 1631, 198, know that well enough . ' 
Lines/p06/p06-058/p06-058-04.png, 1637, 203, Love . She revolted against 
Lines/p06/p06-058/p06-058-05.png, 1741, 179, the word . Nicholas , Philip ... 
Lines/p06/p06-058/p06-058-06.png, 1531, 202, where was happiness , or 
Lines/p06/p06-058/p06-058-07.png, 1839, 207, peace of mind ? Philip put out 
Lines/p06/p06-058/p06-058-08.png, 1718, 194, a hand and grasped hers . 
Lines/p06/p06-058/p06-058-09.png, 1788, 188, He needed her . She would find 
Lines/p06/p06-058/p06-058-10.png, 1965, 167, solace in that fact at least . 
Lines/d01/d01-056/d01-056-00.png, 1718, 96, The most convenient one for the authors 
Lines/d01/d01-056/d01-056-01.png, 1686, 87, has been the text of A. Souter . In this 
Lines/d01/d01-056/d01-056-02.png, 1745, 125, version of the text the Fourth Gospel is 
Lines/d01/d01-056/d01-056-03.png, 1752, 117, printed as just over 1,000 different nouns , 
Lines/d01/d01-056/d01-056-04.png, 1608, 122, verbs , and other parts of speech occurring 
Lines/d01/d01-056/d01-056-05.png, 1792, 101, 15,695 times in their different grammatical 
Lines/d01/d01-056/d01-056-06.png, 1619, 99, forms . There are other texts which could 
Lines/d01/d01-056/d01-056-07.png, 1799, 117, have been used , and ( as shown in Table 1 ) 
Lines/d01/d01-056/d01-056-08.png, 1786, 115, it is not a matter of the greatest importance 
Lines/d01/d01-056/d01-056-09.png, 774, 82, which text is used . 
Lines/d01/d01-024/d01-024-00.png, 1603, 96, Most of those who expound a theory of textual 
Lines/d01/d01-024/d01-024-01.png, 1715, 88, dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was 
Lines/d01/d01-024/d01-024-02.png, 1445, 101, written entirely by one author before the 
Lines/d01/d01-024/d01-024-03.png, 1690, 83, disturbance took place but a few leave it open 
Lines/d01/d01-024/d01-024-04.png, 1550, 79, to suppose that the original book had been 
Lines/d01/d01-024/d01-024-05.png, 1827, 92, revised even before the upheaval . The ingenuity 
Lines/d01/d01-024/d01-024-06.png, 1634, 82, of the theories is impressive and is the best 
Lines/d01/d01-024/d01-024-07.png, 877, 91, argument against them . 
Lines/d01/d01-024/d01-024-08.png, 609, 70, Thomas Spreng 
Lines/d01/d01-016/d01-016-00.png, 1737, 102, The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with 
Lines/d01/d01-016/d01-016-01.png, 1840, 120, the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and 
Lines/d01/d01-016/d01-016-02.png, 1835, 133, plan and to the different public for which , or against which , the author wrote . 
Lines/d01/d01-016/d01-016-03.png, 1646, 111, The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel . 
Lines/d01/d01-098/d01-098-00.png, 1717, 85, The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel 
Lines/d01/d01-098/d01-098-01.png, 1801, 82, and the sheet wound round this central pin . The roll made 
Lines/d01/d01-098/d01-098-02.png, 1774, 90, a simple and serviceable book . It was robust - the number 
Lines/d01/d01-098/d01-098-03.png, 1707, 80, which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of 
Lines/d01/d01-098/d01-098-04.png, 1798, 90, this - and it was easily stored . It had two disadvantages . It 
Lines/d01/d01-098/d01-098-05.png, 1791, 96, was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not 
Lines/d01/d01-098/d01-098-06.png, 1587, 95, an easy form of book in which to find a 
Lines/d01/d01-098/d01-098-07.png, 265, 82, reference . 
Lines/d01/d01-085/d01-085-00.png, 1673, 82, Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that 
Lines/d01/d01-085/d01-085-01.png, 1638, 116, the original of the Gospel would be unmarked . The 
Lines/d01/d01-085/d01-085-02.png, 1832, 120, original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex , 
Lines/d01/d01-085/d01-085-03.png, 1732, 103, whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in 
Lines/d01/d01-085/d01-085-04.png, 1713, 89, columns . This is the invariable practice of ancient 
Lines/d01/d01-085/d01-085-05.png, 1709, 109, manuscripts . A common size of column would hold 
Lines/d01/d01-085/d01-085-06.png, 1602, 110, about one third of a page of Souter's print . 
Lines/d01/d01-052/d01-052-00.png, 1519, 110, THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly 
Lines/d01/d01-052/d01-052-01.png, 1452, 110, written in Greek . A modern text of the 
Lines/d01/d01-052/d01-052-02.png, 1739, 134, Gospel represents the work of generations of 
Lines/d01/d01-052/d01-052-03.png, 1776, 121, scholars who have compared the many manu- 
Lines/d01/d01-052/d01-052-04.png, 1719, 119, scripts of John and worked out the version 
Lines/d01/d01-052/d01-052-05.png, 1741, 143, which is most likely to have been the original 
Lines/d01/d01-052/d01-052-06.png, 1775, 139, wording . It is not possible to establish any one 
Lines/d01/d01-052/d01-052-07.png, 1089, 125, text with absolute precision . 
Lines/d01/d01-060/d01-060-00.png, 1648, 116, At first sight the difference between 
Lines/d01/d01-060/d01-060-01.png, 1783, 89, Souter and the other texts is rather 
Lines/d01/d01-060/d01-060-02.png, 1708, 99, large . But the British text includes 
Lines/d01/d01-060/d01-060-03.png, 1856, 120, the paragraph 7.53-8.11 , the Woman 
Lines/d01/d01-060/d01-060-04.png, 1655, 123, taken in Adultery , and this accounts 
Lines/d01/d01-060/d01-060-05.png, 1740, 123, for 178 words out of 279 , which is 
Lines/d01/d01-060/d01-060-06.png, 1782, 98, the difference between the 15,695 words 
Lines/d01/d01-060/d01-060-07.png, 1910, 106, of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's . 
Lines/d01/d01-060/d01-060-08.png, 1843, 125, The omission or inclusion of this paragraph 
Lines/d01/d01-060/d01-060-09.png, 1723, 104, is a matter of editorial decision rather 
Lines/d01/d01-104/d01-104-00.png, 1619, 86, This last objection might have had some weight in 
Lines/d01/d01-104/d01-104-01.png, 1669, 93, ecclesiastical circles . In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 , 
Lines/d01/d01-104/d01-104-02.png, 1740, 112, the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making . 
Lines/d01/d01-104/d01-104-03.png, 1776, 101, As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which 
Lines/d01/d01-104/d01-104-04.png, 1769, 90, overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his 
Lines/d01/d01-104/d01-104-05.png, 1799, 96, information is contemporaneous with the New Testament . 
Lines/d01/d01-104/d01-104-06.png, 1711, 80, The other form of book was the codex . In this the 
Lines/d01/d01-104/d01-104-07.png, 1752, 100, sheets were bound together down one edge much as 
Lines/d01/d01-104/d01-104-08.png, 960, 95, they are in modern books . 
Lines/d01/d01-019/d01-019-00.png, 1832, 115, There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the 
Lines/d01/d01-019/d01-019-01.png, 1800, 90, Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations . The 
Lines/d01/d01-019/d01-019-02.png, 1746, 120, present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history . The 
Lines/d01/d01-019/d01-019-03.png, 1777, 104, original was written on a roll , or codex , which fell into disorder or was 
Lines/d01/d01-019/d01-019-04.png, 1807, 105, accidentally damaged . An editor , who was not the author , made what he 
Lines/d01/d01-019/d01-019-05.png, 1769, 110, could of the chaos by placing the fragments , or sheets , or pages , in order . 
Lines/d01/d01-049/d01-049-00.png, 1593, 112, The one real weakness of the Commentator's 
Lines/d01/d01-049/d01-049-01.png, 1639, 110, case is that , in common with all his colleagues , 
Lines/d01/d01-049/d01-049-02.png, 1696, 110, he has not , until now , been able to exhibit exactly 
Lines/d01/d01-049/d01-049-03.png, 1633, 125, how this enlargement was effected nor has he 
Lines/d01/d01-049/d01-049-04.png, 1628, 112, been able to explain the textual movements by 
Lines/d01/d01-049/d01-049-05.png, 1566, 128, showing that such changes are part of a 
Lines/d01/d01-049/d01-049-06.png, 1742, 123, simple and coherent plan . To understand how 
Lines/d01/d01-049/d01-049-07.png, 1715, 115, this is possible it is necessary to examine the 
Lines/d01/d01-049/d01-049-08.png, 684, 114, text of the Gospel . 
Lines/d01/d01-080/d01-080-00.png, 1635, 109, The bar was the commonest marking , but others 
Lines/d01/d01-080/d01-080-01.png, 1781, 95, were also used . Dots sometimes served in place of the 
Lines/d01/d01-080/d01-080-02.png, 1772, 114, bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as 
Lines/d01/d01-080/d01-080-03.png, 1849, 137, it is now used to mark a paragraph ending . Frequently 
Lines/d01/d01-080/d01-080-04.png, 1781, 126, paragraphos markings were omitted . C. H. Roberts is of 
Lines/d01/d01-080/d01-080-05.png, 1808, 118, the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel 
Lines/d01/d01-080/d01-080-06.png, 1843, 116, some markings would be used , although which , it is 
Lines/d01/d01-080/d01-080-07.png, 610, 133, impossible to say . 
Lines/d01/d01-123/d01-123-00.png, 1667, 101, The verso of the roll was blank , and one 
Lines/d01/d01-123/d01-123-01.png, 1711, 119, cannot think of an author , Mark for example , 
Lines/d01/d01-123/d01-123-02.png, 1648, 152, sending out his Gospel lacking the ending , 
Lines/d01/d01-123/d01-123-03.png, 1841, 124, while one whole side of his roll was unused . 
Lines/d01/d01-123/d01-123-04.png, 1852, 137, The codex form was not so accommodating . Even 
Lines/d01/d01-123/d01-123-05.png, 1778, 133, in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra 
Lines/d01/d01-123/d01-123-06.png, 1773, 131, sheet glued on might have to be gummed on 
Lines/d01/d01-123/d01-123-07.png, 1766, 139, over the binding , or the whole codex rebound . 
Lines/d01/d01-118/d01-118-00.png, 1920, 133, Against these advantages the codex was fragile and 
Lines/d01/d01-118/d01-118-01.png, 1856, 148, might be bulky . It is sometimes possible to tell 
Lines/d01/d01-118/d01-118-02.png, 1818, 129, whether or not a particular text was written on 
Lines/d01/d01-118/d01-118-03.png, 1641, 118, a roll or a codex . Rolls were prepared for 
Lines/d01/d01-118/d01-118-04.png, 1802, 151, writing , but any papyrus left unused at the 
Lines/d01/d01-118/d01-118-05.png, 1869, 125, end could be cut off . If the text was longer than 
Lines/d01/d01-118/d01-118-06.png, 1631, 146, the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on . 
Lines/e02/e02-091/e02-091-00.png, 1824, 136, As a still further development , we follow 
Lines/e02/e02-091/e02-091-01.png, 1908, 122, with a good basic kit , which includes 
Lines/e02/e02-091/e02-091-02.png, 1914, 149, the fuller kit ( which in its turn , of course , 
Lines/e02/e02-091/e02-091-03.png, 1718, 88, includes the bare minimum kit ) . 
Lines/e02/e02-091/e02-091-04.png, 1812, 139, With this the vast majority of jobs 
Lines/e02/e02-091/e02-091-05.png, 1740, 124, can be done , though for advanced 
Lines/e02/e02-091/e02-091-06.png, 1643, 132, cabinet work the necessity for 
Lines/e02/e02-091/e02-091-07.png, 1629, 124, certain special tools will become 
Lines/e02/e02-091/e02-091-08.png, 414, 71, obvious . 
Lines/e02/e02-021/e02-021-00.png, 1662, 233, Incidentally , it is better to 
Lines/e02/e02-021/e02-021-01.png, 1934, 240, complete any mortising that may be 
Lines/e02/e02-021/e02-021-02.png, 1992, 261, needed at the top before the tapering is 
Lines/e02/e02-021/e02-021-03.png, 1946, 205, begun . Some plain tapered legs have 
Lines/e02/e02-021/e02-021-04.png, 2077, 209, the taper on the two inner faces only , 
Lines/e02/e02-021/e02-021-05.png, 2002, 181, the outer surfaces being vertical as 
Lines/e02/e02-021/e02-021-06.png, 2131, 234, at ( B ) , Fig. 1 . To make a leg such as 
Lines/e02/e02-021/e02-021-07.png, 2022, 198, that at ( D ) , Fig. 1 , the square is first 
Lines/e02/e02-021/e02-021-08.png, 1867, 181, marked out as at ( A ) , Fig. 3 . 
Lines/e02/e02-000/e02-000-00.png, 1705, 151, A great deal of modern furniture has tapered 
Lines/e02/e02-000/e02-000-01.png, 1696, 128, legs , and in reproduction period pieces they 
Lines/e02/e02-000/e02-000-02.png, 1737, 139, are frequently used . The simpler varieties are 
Lines/e02/e02-000/e02-000-03.png, 1741, 138, extremely easy to work , the four sides being 
Lines/e02/e02-000/e02-000-04.png, 1766, 139, simply planed to give the required taper . In 
Lines/e02/e02-000/e02-000-05.png, 1691, 116, the more elaborate varieties , however , a toe is 
Lines/e02/e02-000/e02-000-06.png, 1604, 123, worked in the solid , and this certainly 
Lines/e02/e02-000/e02-000-07.png, 1048, 138, complicates the operation . 
Lines/e02/e02-082/e02-082-00.png, 1949, 179, This last point is certainly important because almost 
Lines/e02/e02-082/e02-082-01.png, 1792, 202, everyone has come to recognise that machines 
Lines/e02/e02-082/e02-082-02.png, 1818, 146, are not only an economic necessity , but that a 
Lines/e02/e02-082/e02-082-03.png, 1683, 189, great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the 
Lines/e02/e02-082/e02-082-04.png, 1753, 188, installation of a power tool . As an elementary 
Lines/e02/e02-082/e02-082-05.png, 1731, 204, example , surely no one can pretend to enjoy 
Lines/e02/e02-082/e02-082-06.png, 1799, 210, ripping out parts from hardwood . Most men 
Lines/e02/e02-082/e02-082-07.png, 1764, 221, would unhesitatingly use a machine if it 
Lines/e02/e02-082/e02-082-08.png, 596, 102, were available . 
Lines/e02/e02-014/e02-014-00.png, 1845, 125, For short ones a smoothing plane can be used . 
Lines/e02/e02-014/e02-014-01.png, 1857, 106, The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers 
Lines/e02/e02-014/e02-014-02.png, 1820, 121, on the newly planed surfaces , and these treated 
Lines/e02/e02-014/e02-014-03.png, 1873, 105, as before . It is unnecessary to mark the taper with 
Lines/e02/e02-014/e02-014-04.png, 1849, 101, the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth 
Lines/e02/e02-014/e02-014-05.png, 1812, 124, of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces 
Lines/e02/e02-014/e02-014-06.png, 287, 110, straight . 
Lines/e02/e02-018/e02-018-00.png, 1964, 122, A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom 
Lines/e02/e02-018/e02-018-01.png, 1854, 99, end reveals when the required amount 
Lines/e02/e02-018/e02-018-02.png, 1883, 99, has been removed , and if care is taken 
Lines/e02/e02-018/e02-018-03.png, 1997, 125, to stop the plane short of the squared 
Lines/e02/e02-018/e02-018-04.png, 1929, 109, pencil line at the top , the work will be 
Lines/e02/e02-018/e02-018-05.png, 1943, 132, accurate . The straight-edge can be used 
Lines/e02/e02-018/e02-018-06.png, 1963, 145, to test the straightness of the sides . 
Lines/e02/e02-025/e02-025-00.png, 1863, 180, Note that squared lines marking 
Lines/e02/e02-025/e02-025-01.png, 1841, 132, the top member of the toe are 
Lines/e02/e02-025/e02-025-02.png, 1867, 119, needed as well as the upper ex- 
Lines/e02/e02-025/e02-025-03.png, 1695, 134, tent of the taper , and in 
Lines/e02/e02-025/e02-025-04.png, 1789, 184, this case it is necessary to 
Lines/e02/e02-025/e02-025-05.png, 1911, 152, mark in the line of the taper 
Lines/e02/e02-025/e02-025-06.png, 1920, 176, with pencil and straight-edge 
Lines/e02/e02-025/e02-025-07.png, 1896, 154, as at ( B ) , Fig. 3 . A saw cut is 
Lines/e02/e02-025/e02-025-08.png, 1749, 145, made at the upper toe line 
Lines/e02/e02-025/e02-025-09.png, 1970, 167, exactly down to the taper line , 
Lines/e02/e02-025/e02-025-10.png, 724, 159, no farther . 
Lines/e02/e02-086/e02-086-00.png, 1632, 88, Coming now to the actual tools and their cost , we begin 
Lines/e02/e02-086/e02-086-01.png, 1641, 78, with what we have called a bare minimum kit . Probably 
Lines/e02/e02-086/e02-086-02.png, 1702, 80, most men have some of the tools already . It will enable 
Lines/e02/e02-086/e02-086-03.png, 1644, 81, a man to make simple , straight-forward things , and in 
Lines/e02/e02-086/e02-086-04.png, 1600, 88, any case may be regarded as a good beginning to 
Lines/e02/e02-086/e02-086-05.png, 1768, 64, which other tools can be added as the need arises . The 
Lines/e02/e02-086/e02-086-06.png, 1668, 83, nature of the work will probably dictate the additions 
Lines/e02/e02-086/e02-086-07.png, 1703, 85, to be made , but as a guide we have given a fuller kit 
Lines/e02/e02-086/e02-086-08.png, 1592, 93, which increases the range of things that can be 
Lines/e02/e02-086/e02-086-09.png, 529, 72, made enormously . 
Lines/e02/e02-117/e02-117-00.png, 1694, 130, Many men with only limited accommodation 
Lines/e02/e02-117/e02-117-01.png, 1806, 78, have to do their woodwork on the kitchen table . 
Lines/e02/e02-117/e02-117-02.png, 1671, 154, Providing this is sound , some perfectly good 
Lines/e02/e02-117/e02-117-03.png, 1792, 89, work can be done on it , but the usual problems 
Lines/e02/e02-117/e02-117-04.png, 1829, 154, are those of the vice , the bench stop , and storage 
Lines/e02/e02-117/e02-117-05.png, 1649, 119, place for tools . The combined bench top and 
Lines/e02/e02-117/e02-117-06.png, 1703, 144, tool cupboard shown here has been specially 
Lines/e02/e02-117/e02-117-07.png, 1594, 122, designed and made for WOODWORKER 
Lines/e02/e02-117/e02-117-08.png, 1373, 188, readers who have this difficulty . 
Lines/e02/e02-094/e02-094-00.png, 1857, 117, Lastly , we suggest certain power tools and 
Lines/e02/e02-094/e02-094-01.png, 1576, 91, machines , the choice of which will 
Lines/e02/e02-094/e02-094-02.png, 1872, 113, depend partly upon the space available 
Lines/e02/e02-094/e02-094-03.png, 1755, 100, in the workshop , the amount one 
Lines/e02/e02-094/e02-094-04.png, 1885, 124, is prepared to pay , and the type of 
Lines/e02/e02-094/e02-094-05.png, 1841, 108, work a man normally does . First , 
Lines/e02/e02-094/e02-094-06.png, 1913, 126, however , a word of advice generally . 
Lines/e02/e02-094/e02-094-07.png, 1823, 101, Do not buy so-called cheap tools or 
Lines/e02/e02-094/e02-094-08.png, 1869, 109, machines . They never are cheap in the 
Lines/e02/e02-094/e02-094-09.png, 1875, 107, long run . They may be inaccurate , 
Lines/e02/e02-100/e02-100-00.png, 1610, 80, Most tools have to lead an intensive life , and faults 
Lines/e02/e02-100/e02-100-01.png, 1725, 90, in design or quality soon become apparent . It is far 
Lines/e02/e02-100/e02-100-02.png, 1591, 89, better to pay the fair price for a tool of good 
Lines/e02/e02-100/e02-100-03.png, 1719, 83, quality , and not handicap yourself from the start . 
Lines/e02/e02-100/e02-100-04.png, 1683, 85, To put it in a slightly different way , do not allow 
Lines/e02/e02-100/e02-100-05.png, 1605, 82, yourself to blame the tools when the job does 
Lines/e02/e02-100/e02-100-06.png, 877, 92, not turn out quite right ! 
Lines/e02/e02-074/e02-074-00.png, 1745, 104, But why woodwork in particular ? Well , there 
Lines/e02/e02-074/e02-074-01.png, 1637, 96, are many reasons . Wood is in good and 
Lines/e02/e02-074/e02-074-02.png, 1751, 103, common supply ; it lends itself to making 
Lines/e02/e02-074/e02-074-03.png, 1620, 101, innumerable useful household items - 
Lines/e02/e02-074/e02-074-04.png, 1830, 109, furniture , fitments , garden items , toys , etc. ; 
Lines/e02/e02-074/e02-074-05.png, 1770, 118, it enables results to be obtained fairly 
Lines/e02/e02-074/e02-074-06.png, 1790, 99, quickly ; it is less expensive than most 
Lines/e02/e02-074/e02-074-07.png, 1782, 92, other materials ; it is a pleasant material 
Lines/e02/e02-074/e02-074-08.png, 1730, 111, to work with ; and , although it does 
Lines/e02/e02-074/e02-074-09.png, 1771, 97, create a certain amount of mess , it is 
Lines/e02/e02-074/e02-074-10.png, 1740, 112, all clean and easily cleared away .
